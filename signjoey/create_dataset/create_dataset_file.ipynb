      "7: HI, I am Lisa Goldsworthy with ACE Carpet and Upholstery Care in Denver, Colorado. And in this segment, we are going to talk about what you should do when you have a spill on your carpet. I am getting a lot of liquid out. Continue to blot until the area is dry. Now, you will find with any spill, especially one of that magnitude, that was quite a bit of liquid that went in there, it goes through the bottom. In this particular case, I feel that it is wet, however, we don't see the color in here. But it is wet. So you just want to blot. And already, already, this carpet sample pretty dry to the touch. Again, the Scotchgard helped us but even a carpet without the Scotchgard, if your carpet is older, its okay. Just this blotting technique really does a lot. So that?s really the most important thing you can do in a spill; is take a white towel and blot it. Take immediate action, got the spill, take immediate action. And be patient. You want it dry as soon as possible. So the other thing I would highly recommend is to take a fan and just put it on the area and let it dry. Now look. Its kind of matted down a little bit from my blotting right? So, just take it, bring that carpet nap up. Bring it back up. And the reason why you want to do that is because then the air flow can get in through this carpet and that you decrease that drying time. You want to get that carpet as dry as possible as quickly as possible. So, good job. First thing is to take a white towel, white cotton tile and blot. Never scrub, never ever scrub. Look what I got just from that blotting right there. And just be patient and blot. Put some muscle in to it. Just continue your blotting. Okay?\n",

      "46: HI. MICHAEL SETO, PROFESSIONAL PHOTOGRAPHER, AND IN THIS CLIP WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT SELECTING AND USING A TRIPOD FOR JEWELRY PHOTOGRAPHY. IT'S A NICE STURDY TRIPOD. IT'S SOMETHING THAT A LOT OF PROFESSIONALS USE. AS WELL, INSTEAD OF JUST THE STANDARD HEAD ON THIS, THIS IS MORE OF A VIDEO HEAD, I USE A BALL HEAD. THIS ONE IS MADE BY REALLY RIGHT STUFF. THEY MAKE SOME FANTASTIC, VERY HIGH QUALITY BALL HEADS, PROBABLY THE CADILLAC OF BALL HEADS AND YOU REALLY NEED ONE OF THESE TO, TO BE ABLE TO TAKE A GOOD SHOT OF A PIECE OF JEWELRY. SO TRIPOD IS IMPORTANT, A NICE HEAVY-DUTY TRIPOD WITH THE GOOD HEAD IS A KEY TO A STABLE CAMERA WHEN DOING JEWELRY PHOTOGRAPHY. FIRST OF ALL, WHEN YOU'RE SHOOTING JEWELRY, WHICH IS A MACRO TYPE SITUATION, MEANING YOU'RE SHOOTING UP CLOSE, YOU ABSOLUTELY NEED A TRIPOD. THERE IS NO WAY YOU'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO SHOOT SOMETHING LIKE THAT AND GET A VERY CLEAR AND SHARP PHOTO WITHOUT USING A TRIPOD, JUST BECAUSE YOU'RE VERY CLOSE TO THE SUBJECT, ANY MOVEMENT WILL BE MAGNIFIED IN THE PHOTOGRAPH. AS WELL, YOU TEND TO SHOOT WITH A SLOWER SHUTTER SPEED SO THAT ALSO EXACERBATES ANY MOVEMENT. SO LET'S LOOK AT A COUPLE OF TRIPODS HERE. YOU CAN GO WITH A VERY BASIC SMALL TRAVEL TRIPOD, THESE ARE FAIRLY ECONOMICAL. THEY COME WITH A LITTLE QUICK DETACH MECHANISM THAT FITS ON THE BOTTOM OF YOUR CAMERA. THESE WILL DO THE JOB IN A PINCH, BUT THEY'RE FAIRLY LIGHT WEIGHT, THEY WILL NOT BE AS STABLE AS A MORE HEAVY-DUTY TRIPOD LIKE THIS ONE. THIS IS A MANFROTTO 055.\n",

YOU WANT INSULATE TOP A FRAME PORTION OF IT AND ALSO YOU WANT INSULATE ACROSS YOUR BEAMS THAT MAKE-YOUR INSIDE CEILING SO YOU-GOT TWO LAYERS OF INSULATION IN CEILING. THAT REALLY HELPS KEEP SOUND FROM GOING UP. ANOTHER CONSIDERATION IS: IF I DO HAVE CEMENT BLOCK WALL CONSTRUCTION ON CEMENT BLOCK SLAB, I-GOT REALLY BE CONCERNED ABOUT MY ROOF BECAUSE THAT IS WHERE ALL MY SOUND IS GOING TO LEAK OUT OF. IF I BUILD STANDARD A FRAME TYPE ROOF, I-GONNA REALLY WANT INSULATE IT AND DEFINITELY USE 2X6 OR 2X8 CONSTRUCTION. I-HERE TALK TO YOU ABOUT SOUNDPROOFING YOUR RECORDING STUDIO. ON THIS BUILDING I HAVE T-111 SIDING ON OUTSIDE, WHICH IS STANDARD CARDBOARD SIDING THAT YOU WILL FIND ON MANY HOMES. IT-PRETTY GOOD FOR STOPPING SOUND, BUT NOT QUITE AS GOOD AS PLYWOOD WOULD BE. IF I WERE BUILDING THIS HOME FROM GROUND UP, OR I WANTED MAKE THIS BETTER, I WOULD PUT T-111 OVER PLYWOOD AND THEN PUT SHINGLES OVER THAT. BUT I-MORE CONCERNED WITH WORKING ON INSIDE OF MY BUILDING; AND THAT-WHERE I SPENT MY MONEY FOR THIS BUILDING WAS ON INSIDE WALLS. WE-GONNA GO IN THERE AND SHOW YOU LITTLE OF THAT IN MOMENT.

THE PIECE PLASTIC-THAT WE-ARE USING-IS A THICK PIECE PLASTIC, BUT IT-IS A BIT TRANSLUCENT, SO YOU CAN-SEE THROUGH, AND IT WILL-BE PERFECT FOR GETTING THE IMAGES, PLACING THE SHEET PAPER UNDERNEATH AND GETTING THE IMAGES TO SHOW THROUGH SO THAT WE CAN GO-AHEAD AND TRACE IT ON-TO THE SHEET PLASTIC. DON'T OVERCROWD THE PLASTIC WITH IMAGES, BUT, THEN AGAIN, DON'T LEAVE ANY LARGE OPEN BLANK SPACES. YOU-MIGHT WANT-TO HOLD UP THE PLASTIC SHEET EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE-JUST-TO GET A CLEAR LOOK AT WHERE YOU-HAVE PLACED YOUR IMAGES AND WHICH SPACES ARE STILL LEFT EMPTY. AND ALSO YOU MIGHT WANT-TO FOLD IT UP JUST ALSO TO SEE WHERE THE FASTENERS ARE GOING TO GO SO YOU KNOW WHERE TO PUT AN IMAGE; YOU DON'T WANT-TO CUT OFF AN IMAGE UNDERNEATH THE FOLD. SO, JUST TO GET A CLEAR LOOK, IT-IS GOOD TO STOP EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE AND JUST TAKE A LOOK AT THE SHEET PLASTIC AND SEE WHERE YOUR IMAGES ARE LYING. SO NOW I-HAVE SHOWED YOU HOW-TO TAKE THE IMAGES AND PUT THEM ON-TO THE SHEET PLASTIC, USING THE ORIGINAL WHITE PAPER, THE ORIGINAL WHITE IMAGES, THAT WE DREW. SO I-WILL GO-AHEAD AND DO THAT. FIRST I WANT-TO GET THE RIGHT SIZE OF MY PLASTIC, AND I-AM GOING-TO CUT IT-TO ABOUT TWENTY FOUR TO THIRTY INCHES LONG. SO I CUT OFF THE EXCESS, AND THEN PUT THE PLASTIC OVER THE SHEET PAPER WITH MY IMAGES THAT I DREW, AND I-AM GOING TO ONLY USE THE PENCIL AT THIS POINT, I-AM NOT GOING-TO START USING ANY KIND OF PERMANENT MARKERS YET. BUT I-AM GOING-TO DRAW DIRECTLY ON-TO THE PLASTIC WHERE I SAW THE IMAGES, WHERE THE IMAGES JUST COME THROUGH ON THE BOTTOM, AND I MOVE THE PLASTIC AROUND FROM PLACE-TO-PLACE SO I CAN GET IMAGES ON DIFFERENT ANGLES AND ON DIFFERENT LOCATIONS OF THE PLASTIC. IT DOESN'T HAVE-TO LOOK EXACTLY THE WAY IT LOOKED ON THE PAPER, THOSE ARE JUST MY ORIGINAL IMAGES THAT I WANT-TO APPLY TO THE PLASTIC, BUT NOT IN THE SAME EXACT PLACE. IT-IS MUCH EASIER TO DRAW THE IMAGES ON THE PLASTIC BY USING THIS WHITE PAPER UNDERNEATH, BECAUSE WHEN YOU DRAW ON THE PLASTIC, THIS PLASTIC SHEET THAT WE-ARE USING, YOU DON'T SEE THE IMAGES, YOU CAN'T REALLY SEE THE PENCIL SO CLEARLY. SO IT-IS A LOT EASIER TO HAVE THE IMAGE UNDERNEATH AND THEN JUST TRACE AROUND IT SO YOU DON'T HAVE-TO WORRY ABOUT WHICH LINES YOU MADE AND WHAT LINES YOU DIDN'T MAKE, BECAUSE SOMETIMES YOU MADE A LINE AND YOU DON'T SEE IT SO CLEARLY. AND WE JUST MOVE THE PLASTIC AROUND, MAKING SURE THAT MOST OF THE AREAS ARE COVERED WITH SOME TYPE OF IMAGE.\n",

IN ENGINE TEMPERATURE CAN GET VERY HOT, AND THERE IS FLUID THAT TRAVELS THROUGH MANY HOLES IN ENGINE AND THIS WILL HELP DISSIPATE HEAT. FLUID IS CALLED ANTIFREEZE, ALSO KNOWN AS ENGINE COOLANT. REASON WE USE COOLANT IS BECAUSE, ALTHOUGH WATER WILL DO ABOUT SAME THING, WATER FREEZES WHEN IT GETS TOO COLD AND IT BOILS WHEN IT GETS TOO HOT. BY MIXING ANTIFREEZE WITH WATER, IT WILL LOWER FREEZING POINT AND WILL RAISE BOILING POINT OF LIQUID. BECAUSE ENGINE DOES GET REALLY HOT, WE ADD ANTIFREEZE MIXTURE SO THAT IT WILL HELP PROTECT ENGINE BETTER AND HAVE LESS LIKELIHOOD OF BOILING INSIDE ENGINE.\n",

TWO TYPE EXTENSION CAN USE: SYNTHETIC WHICH PROBABLY BE LEAST EXPENSIVE HOWEVER NOT DURABLE AS NATURAL HAIR; NATURAL HAIR EXTENSION MADE OF SAME KERATIN PROTEIN HAIR ACTUALLY MADE OF AND CAN UNDERGO SAME THERMAL TOOL AND STYLING NATURAL HAIR CAN GO THROUGH. BONDING YOU CAN EITHER USE GLUE OR WAX AND WHAT YOU'RE GOING DO IS YOU'RE GOING GRAB SMALL SECTION HAIR AND THEN ADD YOUR PIECE UP AT ROOT HAIR THEN THEY USE PROTEIN BOND OR GLUE IN ORDER BOND THAT PART TO REST HAIR. SO IT BONDED BY ROOT HAIR AND THEN YOU CAN ACTUALLY EITHER ADD LENGTH TO OWN NATURAL HAIR OR YOU CAN ADD VOLUME TO NATURAL HAIR. ACTUAL PROCESS OF BONDING BECAUSE OF SIZE OF SECTION YOU ARE TAKING WHICH ARE VERY VERY SMALL YOU'RE GOING TAKE VERY SMALL BUNCH HAIR IN ORDER CREATE THAT BOND -- IT'S VERY TIME CONSUMING PROCESS AND IT'LL PROBABLY TAKE ANYWHERE FROM THREE TO FIVE HOUR IN ORDER DO ENTIRE HEAD GET DESIRED LENGTH YOU NEED OR DESIRED AMOUNT VOLUME YOU NEED. ANOTHER THING THAT IS TO KNOW ABOUT BONDING HAIR IS THAT YOU ARE HAVE UPKEEP WITH BONDING HAIR. YOU WILL PROBABLY EVERY LIKE TWO TO THREE MONTH HAVE GO BACK TO STYLIST HAVE SOME OF THOSE BOND REMOVED AND THEN REPLACE HAIR. AS HAIR GROW THOSE BOND ALSO GROW DOWN HAIR SHAFT SO YOU DO NEED REPLACE THEM AND THERE IS GOOD AMOUNT UPKEEP AND MAINTENANCE INVOLVED. THAT IS HOW BOND NATURAL HAIR.\n",

      "150: ALTHOUGH YOU MAY COMPETE IN SOME TRIATHLONS, ESPECIALLY IN SPRING THAT HAVE POOL SWIMS, A TRUE TRIATHLON TAKES AN OPEN WATER SWIM. AND THERE ARE SOME SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS WHEN COMPETING IN AN OPEN WATER SWIM. THE POORER SWIMMER YOU ARE, THE MORE YOU'LL GAIN TIME WITH WETSUIT. IF YOU HAVE REALLY GOOD BODY POSITION ALREADY, WETSUIT WON'T PICK UP A LOT OF TIME BUT MOST PEOPLE WILL SEE A THREE TO FIVE SECOND PER HUNDRED IMPROVEMENT AND THAT'S A REALLY NICE THING. ANOTHER NICE THING, OF COURSE IS THAT YOU'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO WEAR WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO RUN AND BIKE IN UNDERNEATH THE WETSUIT AND THEN JUST PEEL IT OFF AND BE READY TO GO. SO EVEN THOUGH YOU'RE GOING TO LOSE A BIT OF TIME TAKING A WETSUIT OFF, YOU GAIN IT BY HAVING THAT GEAR ON UNDERNEATH. SOME OTHER SPECIFICS WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT OPEN WATER SWIMMING IS YOU NEED TO GET USED TO STARTING FAST. IT'S REAL EASY TO GET LULLED INTO THE GROUP YOUR WITH. SO YOU WANT TO GET OFF THE LINE QUICK AND YOU COULD PRACTICE THAT IN SWIMMING BY DOING SOME FAST FIFTIES RIGHT BEFORE YOU DO YOUR LONG SETS OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT TO GET OUT AND THEN QUICKLY SETTLE INTO YOUR RHYTHM. YOU DON'T WANT TO JUST KIND OF EASE INTO THE THING YOU GET INTO A SLOW GROUP. IF YOU HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO GO TO A LAKE TO SWIM WITH A LITTLE TRIATHLON CLUB OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT TO PRACTICE OPEN WATER SWIMMING, IT'S A GREAT THING TO DO. YOU COULD PRACTICE DRAFTING OFF SOMEBODY, WHAT IT'S LIKE TO SWIM RIGHT CLOSE BEHIND AND AGAIN THAT'S JUST BEST EXPERIENCED BY DOING IT. SOME OF THEM YOU CAN ADDRESS IN TRAINING AND SOME OF THEM REALLY JUST NEED TO BE ADDRESSED BY THE EXPERIENCE OF DOING THE RACES. SOME OTHER THINGS YOU CAN PRACTICE IN THE POOL, SIGHTING. IN AN OPEN WATER SWIM, EVERY SIX OR EIGHT STROKES, YOU NEED TO CHOP THE STROKE SHORT AND STICK YOUR HEAD UP. STAYING ON COURSE IS A WHOLE OTHER ASPECT OF OPEN WATER SWIMMING. SO TRY TO PICK SOMETHING ON THE SHORE LINE, NOT THE BUOY THAT YOU'RE SWIMMING FOR, BUT A BOAT RAMP OR A HOME OR LAMP POLE OR SOMETHING SO THAT IF YOU'VE GOT A SEA OF BRIGHT ORANGE CAPS IN FRONT OF YOU, THAT YOU STILL KNOW WHAT YOU'RE SWIMMING FOR. SO THOSE ARE SOME REAL KEY AND SPECIFIC THINGS FOR WHEN YOU TACKLE THAT OPEN WATER SWIM. ONE OF THE MOST BASIC TIPS: PUT ON YOUR GOGGLES, THEN PUT THE CAP ON OVER TOP OF THE GOGGLES AND THAT WAY, IF YOU COLLIDE WITH SOMEBODY AND THEIR HAND DRAGS ALONG YOUR HEAD, IT WON'T RIP YOUR GOGGLES OFF. YOU NEED TO PRACTICE SWIMMING IN YOUR WETSUIT. SWIMMING IN A WETSUIT IS COMPLETELY DIFFERENT THAN SWIMMING WITHOUT ONE. YOU'LL PROBABLY USE ONE TO TWO STROKES LESS PER LENGTH, YOU'LL GLIDE MORE AND YOU'LL RIDE HIGHER IN THE WATER. SO, YOU CAN TAKE IT INTO THE POOL AND SWIM A BIT IN IT JUST TO GET ACCUSTOMED TO IT. IT FEELS VERY DIFFERENT. IT'S VERY EFFICIENT.\n",

I HAVE-HER ACTUALLY TURN-IN THE SAME DIRECTION AS THE FACE-IS, AND HAVING-TO TRY-TO CREATE A MOVEMENT WITH-HER. AND THE REASON I PUT THE ARM HERE, WITH-THE BODY, IS YOU WANT-TO BE-ABLE-TO HAVE AN INTER-RELATION BETWEEN THE BIGGER HEAD AND THE SMALLER BODY BY HAVING MAYBE SOMETHING COME-OUT PERSPECTIVE.

WELL OBVIOUSLY WHAT I DREW FOR THESE TWO PEOPLE HERE, THEY DIDN'T HAVE THESE POSES LIKE THIS. SO I TRY-TO THINK ABOUT HOW THERE PERSONALITIES ARE, AND THEY TELL ME ABOUT WHAT THEY LIKE, AND SOMETIMES YOU JUST ASK THE CLIENT WHAT ARE THE KINDS OF THINGS THAT YOU'RE INTERESTED IN. AND USUALLY THEY WOULD TELL YOU, OH I LOVE WONDER WOMAN, OR I LOVE SUPERMAN. OKAY YOU CAN GO-FROM THERE AND ILLUSTRATE THAT. SO HOW AM I GOING-TO CREATE WONDER WOMAN IN HER POSE.

      "171: HI I'M DIANA KORTEN AND I'M HERE TODAY WITH BEN TO TALK ABOUT COMMON CAT ILLNESSES. I'VE CHOSEN BEN TO DO THIS SEGMENT WITH US BECAUSE HE GETS URINARY TRACT INFECTIONS PRETTY EASILY. I'M JUST FILLING THIS BOX WITH THE HEALTH CHECK LITTER AND WHAT WILL HAPPEN IS WHEN THE CAT GOES TO THE BATHROOM IT WILL JUST BE YELLOW. IF THE CAT PEES AND IT STAYS YELLOW THEN THAT IS A SIGN THAT THINGS ARE PROBABLY OKAY. IF THE COLOR CHANGES AND YOU GET A RED, THAT USUALLY TELLS YOU THAT THERE IS A LITTLE URINE IN THE BLOOD AND YOU WANT TO GET HE CAT TO HAVE IT CHECKED OUT. BEN IS BEING VERY COOPERATIVE TODAY AND WE'RE GOING TO SEE HOW HIS URINE COMES OUT. IT IS LOOKING VERY YELLOW AND IT IS JUST LOOKING VERY YELLOW SO THAT TELLS US THAT BEN IS DOING VERY WELL TODAY. IF IT CHANGED COLOR THEN THAT WOULD TELL US THAT WE NEED TO BE ON THE LOOK OUT AND WE NEED TO TAKE HIM TO THE VET. THE REASON WHY WE ARE IN THE BATHROOM TODAY IS THAT FOR SOME REASON CATS ARE DRAWN TO THE BATHROOM WHEN THEY'RE NOT FEELING WELL. A CAT WITH A URINARY TRACT INFECTION WILL OFTEN PEE RIGHT OVER THE DRAIN SO IF YOU COME IN THE BATHROOM AND YOU SMELL A LITTLE CAT URINE ODOR OR YOU SEE A LITTLE YELLOW AROUND THE DRAIN THAT IS A GOOD SIGN THAT YOUR CAT MIGHT HAVE A URINARY TRACT INFECTION AND YOU WANT TO RUSH HIM TO THE VET BECAUSE THEY CAN DIE FROM UTI'S. SOME WAYS THAT YOU CAN HELP YOUR CAT PREVENT FROM GETTING UTI'S AND KIDNEY FAILURE IS TO KEEP THEM WELL HYDRATED. I WOULD LIKE TO ADVOCATE FEEDING YOUR CAT WET FOOD WHICH CONTAINS A LOT OF WATER. BASICALLY YOU WANT TO WATCH FOR THINGS LIKE LOSS OF APPETITE. CATS ARE NOT NATURAL DRINKERS. OCCASIONALLY YOU WILL GET A CAT WHO LOVES TO DRINK A LOT OF WATER BUT MOST CATS AREN'T REALLY GOOD WATER DRINKERS. THEY ARE ORIGINALLY A DESERT ANIMAL. THEIR ANCESTORS GOT MOST OF THEIR MOISTURE FROM THEIR KILL SO GIVING THEM A WET DIET MEANS THAT THEY GET A LOT OF MOISTURE IN THEIR FOOD LIKE THEIR ANCESTORS DID. FROM DAY ONE YOU WANT TO TAKE YOUR CAT IN FOR AN ANNUAL HEALTH CHECK, EVEN IF THERE IS NOTHING GOING ON. ONCE YOUR CAT GETS TO BE EIGHT YEARS OLD YOU REALLY WANT TO TAKE THAT CAT IN ONCE EVERY SIX MONTHS TO GET A LITTLE BLOOD WORK DONE, GET THESE THINGS CHECKED OUT BECAUSE A LOT OF THINGS, THERE ARE A LOT OF ILLNESSES THAT YOUR VET CAN CATCH EARLY THAT DON'T HAVE TO BE TERMINAL BUT IF YOU CATCH THEM LATE, IF YOU WAIT FOR YOUR CAT TO POINT YOU TO THE SYMPTOMS, YOU MAY FIND THAT BY THAT TIME IT IS REALLY TOO LATE. YOU WANT TO CHECK THEIR FUR AND IF THEIR FUR GETS DEHYDRATED. YOU WANT TO PULL ON IT LIKE THIS AND YOU SEE HOW BEN'S JUST SORT OF POPS BACK DOWN. IF YOU PULL ON IT LIKE THIS IT WILL STAY UP IF THEY'RE DEHYDRATED AND THAT TELLS YOU THAT SOMETHING IS GOING ON. HIDING IS ANOTHER SYMPTOM. THEY ARE TRYING TO HIDE THEIR ILLNESS SO THEY TRY TO HIDE THEIR WHOLE SELVES. FORTUNATELY WE HAVE SOME TOOLS THAT CAN HELP US AS WELL. IF YOUR CAT IS GETTING A LITTLE BIT OLDER YOU MIGHT WANT TO CONSIDER USING A DIAGNOSTIC LITTER PERIODICALLY JUST AS A ROUTINE CHECK TO MAKE SURE THAT THE CAT IS NOT ILL.\n",

WE HAVE TO INSTALL THE SILENCERS THAT CAME ON THE USED ONES, I'M TRANSFERRING ONTO THE NEW ONES BECAUSE IT DIDN'T COME EQUIP WITH THOSE. AND YOU REMEMBER THERE IS TWO DISTINCTIVELY DIFFERENT STYLE SILENCERS USED. THE OUTBOARD PAD HAD THE WIDE FINGERS OF THE OUTER SIDE OF CALIPER FOR SEALING SO I USED THE WIDE FINGER. DO YOU TO SEE WHERE IT IS SEALED ON BEFORE, THAT'S THE OUTBOARD PAD THAT APPLIES JUST TO THAT. THIS IS THE INBOARD PAD WHERE THE PISTON APPLIES PRESSURE AGAINST THE BRAKE PAD AND THAT'S DONE IN THE CENTER. NOW, YOU WANT THESE TABS TO BE SECURELY MOUNTED, THE WAY TO DO SO IS YOU TAKE A LARGE PAIR OF CHANNEL LOCK PLIERS AND YOU JUST ADJUST THEM FOR COMFORTABLE GRIP ACROSS THE PAD AND YOU JUST SQUEEZE ON. THERE'S TWO TABS ON ONE SIDE, ONE IN THE CENTER, JUST SQUEEZE AND LOCK THOSE DOWN ALL THREE TABS, AND THAT SECURES THE BRAKE SILENCER TO THE PAD. AND JUST AS SAFE AS YOU DO AGAIN WITH THE OTHER BRAKE PAD, AND IT'S SECURE. NOW, WE CAN INSTALL THE PADS INTO THE CALIPER MOUNTING BRACKET. PRIOR TO DOING SO, WHERE THE PADS SLIDE BACK AND FORTH IN THE CALIPER ASSEMBLIES, WE WANT TO MAKE SURE AND LUBRICATE THAT AREA. YOU'VE GOT TWO PADS FOR EACH SIDE OF THE VEHICLE. WE WANT TO USE A VERY SMALL AMOUNT OF LUBRICANT BECAUSE WE DON'T WANT AN EXCESS TO GET ON THE PADS OR AROUND IN THE BRAKE SYSTEM, JUST ADEQUATE TO LUBRICATE THE SYSTEM. PLEASE WATCH OUR NEXT SEGMENT AND WE'LL COVER INSTALLING THE PADS PART 2. AS YOU'VE NOTICED, THERE IS THE DIFFERENCE IN TWO OF THE PADS. TWO PADS ARE IDENTICAL. THAT'S THE OUTBOARD PAD ON EACH SIDE AND THE TWO INBOARD PADS ARE INVERTED SO THAT THE WARNING TAB IS LOCATED IN CORRECT POSITION. SO IF YOU TAKE THE BRAKE PADS, YOU JUST REMOVE AND MATCH THEM UP. THESE TWO MATCHED. THIS IS MY INBOARD ONE. BOTH OUTBOARD PADS ARE IDENTICAL FOR SIDES SO JUST SELECT ONE, NOW I HAVE MY 2 PADS.\n",

      "208: SO WHAT JAPANESE GREEN TEA ON THIS SIDE HAVE CHINESE GREEN TEA THIS SIDE JAPANESE GREEN TEA WHICH I WILL FOCUS ON RIGHT NOW. BECAUSE JAPANESE DRINK SO MUCH GREEN TEA THEY HAVE TO IMPORT CHINA SENCHA TEA. SO WHAT THEY DO IS THEY ASK THEIR CHINESE COUNTERPART TO PRODUCE TEA THAT'S MADE WAY THEY DO. AND WHAT JAPANESE DO IS AFTER THEY PICK TEA LEAVES THEY STEAM THE TEA LEAVES INCREASING THE CORAFIL. THEREFORE WHEN YOU LOOK AT JAPANESE GREEN TEA IT IS GREENER THAN CHINESE GREEN TEA. FROM SENCHA THE LEADER PICKING IS CALLED BANCHA AND WHAT THEY DO IS THEY TAKE BANCHA AND THEY ROAST IT IT'S CALLED HOJICHA WHICH IS ROASTED TEA. AND THE BANCHA AS WELL THEY ADD RICE KERNELS AND THEY CALL THAT GENMAICHA WHICH IS MADE FROM AGAIN SAME STYLE TEA IT'S JUST WHEN IT'S PICKED. THEREFORE WHEN YOU THINK OF JAPANESE GREEN TEA IT'S ONE BASIC STYLE OF TEA THAT HAS BEEN MANIPULATED TO CREATE THE DIFFERENT STYLES THE DIFFERENT FLAVORS OF JAPANESE GREEN TEA. JAPANESE GREEN TEA STARTS WITH A BUSH. IT'S ABOUT 3 FEET HIGH AND IT'S PICKED 4 TIMES TO 5 TIMES MOST THROUGH OUT THE YEAR. AND IT STARTS IN THE EARLY SPRING ABOUT APRIL OR SO DEPENDING AGAIN ON THE WEATHER PATTERN. AND THAT SPECIFIC TEA IS CALLED SINCHA VERY FIRST PICKING OF THE YEAR. AND THAT STYLE TYPE OF TEA ONLY LASTS ABOUT 7 TO 10 DAYS MAX. AFTER THAT THEY HAVE ANOTHER PICKING AND THAT STYLE TEA IS CALLED SENCHA. MOST OF THE TEA CONSUMED IN JAPAN IS CALLED SENCHA. AND THEY ALSO EXPORT IT TO OVER SEAS IS THE STYLE OF SENCHA.\n",

THAT WAY YOU CAN JUST DUMP THEM ALL IN THERE AND DIG THROUGH THEM AS YOU NEED THEM. IF YOU DON'T HAVE THAT MANY, YOU CAN ALWAYS JUST USE A DRAWER TRAY LIKE THIS, WHICH IS REALLY NICE BECAUSE YOU CAN JUST SLIDE IT IN A DRAWER AND OUT OF SIGHT OUT OF MIND WHEN YOU'RE NOT SCRAPBOOKING.

AND THEN AT SOME POINT YOU CAN DO-THE TWICE ON ONE FOOT, TWICE ON THE OTHER, AND BREATH. BUT MAKE-SURE YOUR HANDS ARE NOT GOING INTO BIG CIRCLE, OK? MAKE-SURE YOUR FEET ARE NOT GOING WAY UP AND A GOOD PLACE TO DO-THIS IS ACTUALLY IN THE MIRROR. ONCE YOU-DO THAT FOR A TWO MINUTE ROUND, IN FACT I'VE-EVEN HAD SOME-OF THE KIDS DOING THEM FOR THREE TWO MINUTE ROUNDS, BECAUSE YOU'LL ACTUALLY GET THE SAME WORKOUT WITHOUT THE JUMP ROPE ANYWAY, BUT YOU LOOK KIND-OF FOOLISH SOMETIMES WHEN THE OTHER BOXERS ARE-LOOKING AT YOU AND YOU DON'T HAVE A JUMP ROPE AND YOU'RE STILL JUMPING. BUT THE BEST WAY TO LEARN HOW TO JUMP ROPE, TAKE-THE JUMP ROPE, SET IT ASIDE, GO THROUGH THE MOTION. YOU CAN DO-IT RIGHT IN THE MIRROR SO YOU CAN SEE YOURSELF. UP-AND DOWN, TRY-IT, I'LL-BET YOU'LL BE SURPRISED.

NOW WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO DO IS YOU'RE GOING TO GET IN A POSITION FOR JUMP ROPING AND YOU'RE GOING TO MAKE BELIEVE YOU HAVE A JUMP ROPE, OK?

BUT THERE ARE GAMES THAT HAVE STOOD TEST OF TIME SUCH AS FIVE CARD DRAW, FIVE CARD STUD, OMAHA, SEVEN CARD STUD, OMAHA HI-LO, LIST GO ON AND ON. ESSENTIAL THING YOU NEED KNOW TO LEARN HOW PLAY POKER IS STARTING VALUE OF EACH HAND. STARTING VALUE RANGES FROM HIGH CARD ALL WAY TO ROYAL FLUSH AND THEN THERE RANKINGS IN BETWEEN. HIGH CARD IS SIMPLY AS IT STATES, ACE WHEN YOU CONSIDER HIGH CARD IS LISTED AS HIGH CARD. NEXT RANKING WOULD BE PAIR, THAT WOULD BE ANY TWO CARDS THAT ARE OF SAME NUMBER. NEXT RANKING AFTER THAT WOULD BE TWO PAIR, THAT WOULD BE TWO CARDS OR FOUR CARDS THAT HAVE SAME NUMERICAL VALUE OF OTHER ONE. SO ME MAY HAVE MADE THAT LITTLE CONFUSING, LET JUST SAY IF YOU HAVE TWO THREES AND TWO NINES, THAT WOULD BE TWO PAIR.\n",

WHAT I MEAN BY THAT IS THINK ABOUT WHAT YOU SAY BEFORE YOU SAY IT. THERE’S AN OLD SAYING THAT I THINK IS REAL IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER WHEN WE’RE TALKING ABOUT CRITICISM, WHETHER IT’S WRITTEN OR SPOKEN: “YOU CAN NEVER TAKE IT BACK.” ONCE THE WORDS ARE OUT THERE, THEY ARE OUT THERE. SO, THINK ABOUT WHAT YOU’RE GOING TO SAY BEFORE YOU SAY IT. IF SOMEONE IS ATTACKING YOU OR SOMETHING IS COMING AT YOU, IT’S HARDER NOT TO JUMP ON THAT AND ACT VERY QUICKLY AND TELL SOMEBODY HOW TERRIBLE THEY ARE OR WHAT A JERK THEY ARE OR WHATEVER IT IS. BUT TRY TO STOP, THINK ABOUT IT SO THAT THE WORDS YOU SAY ARE NOT HURTFUL, MORE CRITICAL, AND NEGATIVE, AND DON’T EXACERBATE THE WHOLE SITUATION.\n",

THE KEY HERE IS YOU HAVE YOUR RACQUET IN AN ALREADY READY POSITION LIKE THIS, AND YOU JUST TOSS IT UP AND SMASH IT. SO, IT'S A PRETTY GOOD SERVE. THE GOOD NEWS ABOUT IT IS THAT YOU ARE ABLE TO REALLY DRILL THE BALL AT YOUR OPPONENT. A LOT OF PEOPLE, IF YOU HIT THE BALL AT AN ANGLE ABOUT THEIR SHOULDER HEIGHT WITH A LOT OF PACE, THEY HAVE A HARD TIME WITH IT. THE THING TO BE CAREFUL ABOUT WITH AN OVERHEAD SERVE, THOUGH, IS IF YOU HIT IT TOO HARD, YOU'RE NOT ABLE TO GET POSITIONED FOR THE NEXT SHOT. JUST TO DEMONSTRATE AGAIN, IF YOU WANT TO JUST HIT IT LIKE THAT, YOU ARE GOING TO SWING AND HIT IT. WE'RE GOING TO SHOW ANOTHER ANGLE OF THIS SERVE SO YOU CAN GET A FEEL FOR THE MECHANICS. AS YOU CAN SEE, I'M AT AN OPEN ANGLE WITH THE BALL, AND I JUST TOSS THE BALL AND SMASH IT. IN THE NEXT SEGMENT, WE ARE GOING TO COVER WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE FROM THE FRONT AND MAYBE A LITTLE BIT FROM THE SIDE.\n",

SOMETHING LIKE THAT IS ALWAYS GOING TO HAVE PING PONG BALLS—ANYWHERE THAT SELLS SPORTS EQUIPMENT LIKE THAT. SO, YOU NEED WATER. JUST FILL IT UP WITH YOUR SINK. THAT'S REALLY EASY.

      "340: HELLO, MY NAME IS ADRIAN ARCEO AND NOW WE'RE GOING TO GET INTO SOME FIRST AND THIRD BASE COACHING. NOW, DON'T THINK THAT JUST BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT BETWEEN THOSE TWO WHITE LINES THAT YOU'RE NOT AN IMPORTANT PART OF THE OFFENSE, BECAUSE EVEN THE SMARTEST BASE RUNNERS, NEEDS HELP GETTING AROUND THE BASES. SO DON'T BE FOOLED, BEING A FIRST AND THIRD BASE COACH IS ACTUALLY VERY IMPORTANT! NOW, AS A FIRST BASE COACH OR A THIRD BASE COACH YOU HAVE TO BE SMART, YOU HAVE TO HAVE A LOT OF EXPERIENCE, YOU HAVE TO MAKE SPLIT SECOND DECISIONS AND KNOW THE CAPABILITIES OF NOT ONLY THE PLAYERS ON YOUR TEAM, BUT THE PLAYERS ON THE OTHER TEAM. NOW, BETWEEN THE FIRST AND THIRD BASE COACHES, THERE'S ACTUALLY A LOT OF COMMUNICATION GOING ON, BUT EACH INDIVIDUAL COACH HAS DIFFERENT RESPONSIBILITIES. USUALLY THE FIRST BASE COACH IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE RUNNER BETWEEN HOME AND FIRST BASE. AS SOON AS THE RUNNER STARTS HEADING OUT TO SECOND BASE, THE RESPONSIBILITY GETS HANDED ONTO THE THIRD BASE COACH. NOW AS A BASE COACH YOU HAVE TO RESPOND TO DIFFERENCES IN OUTS, COUNTS, INNINGS, PLAYERS, SITUATIONS AND GAME INTENSITY. SO THERE'S A LOT TO GO INTO WHEN IT COMES TO COACHING THIRD AND FIRST BASE. AND, JUST AS IN A GAME, WHEN AN UMPIRE MAKES A BAD CALL, IT CAN CHANGE THE ENTIRE OUTCOME OF THE GAME. A BAD DECISION OR A BAD CALL BY THE FIRST OR THIRD BASE COACHES CAN ACTUALLY CHANGE THE ENTIRE GAME COMPLETELY.\n",

I MEAN PIECE LIKE THIS STRAIGHT OUT STORE OR GLASS FACTORY THESE EDGES AREN'T GO BE TREMENDOUSLY SHARP BECAUSE THEY KIND SQUARE OFF. BUT YOU CAN STILL CUT YOURSELF ON THESE EDGES SO YOU WANT BE CAREFUL. BUT I GUESS MAIN THING IS AND I HAVE ALREADY MENTIONED THIS BUT ANYTIME YOU ARE CUTTING GLASS BREAKING GLASS OR GRINDING GLASS YOU SHOULD PROBABLY BE WEARING YOUR SAFETY GOGGLES BECAUSE YOU CAN SOMETIMES JUST HAVE VERY VERY SMALL PIECES GLASS FLY UP. AND IF THEY GET YOUR EYE THEY CAN CAUSE PROBLEM OBVIOUSLY. BUT JUST BE KIND ALWAYS AWARE WHERE EDGES ARE. IF YOU ARE CAREFUL AND DO THINGS CONTROLLED MANNER SOMETIMES YOU WILL HAVE GLASS BREAKING WHEN YOU DON'T WANT IT TO BUT MOST TIME YOU WILL BE ABLE CONTROL WHAT IT IS DOING. I GUESS WHAT I AM SAYING IS YOU WANT DEVELOP CERTAIN CONFIDENCE WORKING WITH GLASS SO THAT YOU ARE COMFORTABLE CUTTING IT AND BREAKING IT AND YOU'RE NOT AFRAID ALL TIME THAT YOU ARE GO CUT YOURSELF OR END UP SOME DISASTER. BECAUSE TO CERTAIN DEGREE CONFIDENCE IS PART SAFETY BEING CONFIDENT WHAT YOU ARE DOING. BUT AT SAME TIME YOU DON'T WANT BE SO OVER CONFIDENT THAT YOU FORGET WHERE SHARP EDGES ARE OR YOU FORGET WEAR YOUR SAFETY GLASSES. SO JUST KIND THINK ABOUT THAT WHEN YOU ARE WORKING WITH GLASS. ONE THINGS ABOUT GLASS IS BECAUSE IT IS GLASS IS PRETTY STRONG BUT IT'S BRITTLE OKAY. SO WHAT THAT MEANS IS YOU SHOULDN'T BE AFRAID WORK WITH GLASS. YOU SHOULDN'T BE AFRAID THAT IT IS JUST GOING BE BREAKING ALL TIME BUT YOU DO HAVE BE CAREFUL WITH IT OKAY. SO LOT TECHNIQUES STAINED GLASS REQUIRE YOU ACTIVELY BREAK PIECE GLASS WITH YOUR HANDS OR WITH PLIERS AND YOU SHOULDN'T BE AFRAID THAT BECAUSE IT IS PART TECHNIQUE. BUT BECAUSE IT'S BRITTLE LOT TIMES IT CAN BREAK WHEN YOU DON'T WANT IT SO WE WANT TALK ABOUT THAT LITTLE BIT. BUT ALSO OBVIOUSLY BROKEN GLASS CAN BE VERY SHARP RIGHT?

YOU NEED TO BE VERY CAREFUL WHEN YOU MELT GLASS BECAUSE IF YOU HEAT GLASS UP TOO QUICKLY, IT'S JUST LIKE DROPPING AN ICE CUBE INTO A HOT GLASS OF TEA, IT WILL SHATTER VERY QUICKLY; IT'S CALLED THERMO-SHOCKING. SO WITH A PIECE OF GLASS WITH A DIAMETER THIS LARGE, YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU INTRODUCE IT INTO THE FLAME VERY, VERY SLOWLY, AND YOU START AT THE BACK END OF THE FLAME, ABOUT SIX INCHES OUT FROM THE HEAD OF THE TORCH. REMEMBER, THE THICKER THE DIAMETER OF YOUR GLASS, THE MORE SLOWLY YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO INTRODUCE IT TO THE FLAME. AS THIS GLASS STARTS TO HEAT UP AND GETS TO THE POINT THAT IT'S MALLEABLE ENOUGH TO WORK, IT'LL START TO GET AN ORANGE GLOW TO THE TIP. AS THE ORANGE INCREASES GOING DOWN THE TUBE, YOU CAN THEN BRING THE GLASS CLOSER AND CLOSER TO THE HEAD OF THE TORCH. YOU NEVER WANT TO WORK CLOSER THAN ABOUT TWO INCHES TO THE HEAD OF THE TORCH. NOW YOU CAN BEGIN TO SEE THE TIP IS ORANGE; YOU INTRODUCE MORE OF THE GLASS, AND AS YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT AS YOU'RE HEATING THE GLASS, YOU KEEP ROTATING THE ROD IN YOUR HAND. AS YOU CONTINUE TO HEAT, THE ORANGE COLOR WILL SPREAD, AND EVENTUALLY, THE GLASS IS GOING TO BECOME THE CONSISTENCY OF WARM HONEY, AND IT'S GOING TO START TO DROOP WHEN YOU HOLD THE ROD STILL. WHEN YOU HAVE THIS DROOP, IT'S FINALLY TIME TO WORK YOUR GLASS.\n",

      "395: ALRIGHT, SO LET US START OFF LOOKING OVER SOME OF THE MATERIALS THAT WE WILL USE FOR THESE BASIC DINGS, YOU KNOW. OBVIOUSLY, IT IS A STEP PROCESS. THAT IS WHAT SAND PAPER IS FOR. YOU GOT ONE TWENTY, TWO TWENTY. THE PREPPING USUALLY STARTS WITH THE FIFTY GRIT, WHICH IS A MUCH MORE COARSE SAND PAPER. YOU CAN FIND THAT AT ANY, YOU KNOW, HOME IMPROVEMENT STORE OR HOME DEPOT. I MEAN, ALL OF THAT STUFF. THE SECOND, YOU OBVIOUSLY YOU NEED FIBERGLASS AND RESIN. THAT IS OVER HERE. GLOVES. YOU DEFINITELY WANT TO USE GLOVES WHEN IT COMES TO USING THESE MATERIALS. WHAT WE HAVE IS, THIS IS LAMINATION RESIN. WHAT YOU WANT TO DO FIRST IS YOU WANT TO PREP AND FILL THE DING. YOU COULD GET THAT AT ANY KIND OF PLASTIC STORE. SURF SHOPS ACTUALLY CARRY MOST OF THIS DING REPAIR STUFF NOWADAYS. AFTER THE LAM RESIN, THERE IS HOT COAT RESIN. WHICH IS SURFACING AGENT RESIN, WHICH IS SANDING RESIN. AND, ALL THAT THAT IS IS LAMINATING RESIN WITH A SURFACING AGENT IN IT THAT YOU ADD. BUT, OBVIOUSLY YOU COULD BUY IT AS A HOT COAT. BRUSHES TO APPLY THE RESIN, YOU KNOW. WE GOT SQUEEGEES TO SQUEEGEE OUT THE RESIN AFTER YOU SATURATE IT. AND THEN, OBVIOUSLY YOU NEED ACETONE TO CLEAN YOUR TOOLS AND YOURSELF. WE'VE GOT FIBERGLASS, WHICH IS OBVIOUSLY REALLY IMPORTANT. AND, FOR THAT WHAT WE WILL USE IS JUST ANY KIND OF NORMAL, YOU KNOW, MAT KNIFE THAT YOU COULD GET FROM HOME DEPOT. THIS IS A FOUR OUNCE FIBER GLASS. AND, WHAT YOU DO IS, YOU KNOW, YOU USE THE RESIN TO APPLY THE FIBERGLASS AND GET IT TO BOND TO THE SURF BOARD. AND THEN, THIS IS WHAT IS CALLED Q CELL, OR MICRO BALLOONS. AND, WHAT IT IS IT IS JUST A FINELY CHOPPED FIBER GLASS. AND IT, WHAT I CALL IT IS A SURF BOARD BONDO, YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN. AND, THAT IS WHAT YOU ARE GOING TO DO. YOU ARE GOING TO MIX IT LAMINATING RESIN, AND YOU ARE GOING TO FILL THAT IN. AND, IT IS JUST GOING TO TAKE UP THE SPACE THAT WAS TAKEN AWAY FROM THE SURF BOARD. ALL DING REPAIRS, THE FIBER GLASS THAT YOU PUT ON IS ACTUALLY ON TOP OF THE SURFACE. ONCE YOU GET IT BACK TO ITS NORMAL STATE, THAT IS WHEN YOU DO YOUR STRUCTURAL DAMAGE, YOU KNOW. ANY STRAIGHT EDGE, YOU KNOW, EVEN A RAZOR BLADE WILL WORK IN SOME OF THESE INSTANCES. AND, APPLY THOSE PRODUCTS. FROM OUR TOOLS AND MATERIALS, LET US GET INTO THE REAL SAFETY PART OF THIS PROCESS. YOU DEFINITELY WANT SAND PAPER. GOLDEN RULE ABOUT SURFBOARD REPAIR, RESIN WILL NOT BOND TO ANYTHING THAT IS NOT PREPPED WHICH MEANS IT HAS TO BE COARSE AND SANDED. SO, IF YOU THINK YOU CAN JUST POUR THE RESIN IN THE HOLE AND IT WILL BOND, IT WILL NOT. AT LEAST SAND IT FIRST. RESIN WILL BOND TO IT.\n",

HERE'S EXAMPLE OF DOOR THAT IS NEARLY PERFECTLY SET UP. YOUHAVE GOT DOOR HANDLE WITH KEY, YOUHAVE GOT DEADBOLT AND DOOR FRAME ITSELF IS ACTUALLY RECESSED IN SO THAT YOU CAN'T GET CREDIT CARD IN BEHIND HERE. COUPLE OF THINGTHAT I DID NOTICE ABOUT THIS DOOR. ONE, THIS LOCK SET UP PROPERLY, INSTALLED PROPERLY BUT DEADBOLT YOU WILL SEE IS ACTUALLY UPSIDE DOWN. THIS CAUSE PROBLEM WITH SPRINGS. EVENTUALLY THAT WILL CAUSE WEAKNESS IN SPRINGS AND LOCK WILL FAIL BECAUSE IT IS HANGING UPSIDE DOWN AND YOU DON'T HAVE GRAVITY IN YOUR FAVOR. ANOTHER SECURITY ISSUE THAT I SEE WITH THIS DOOR IS THIS WINDOW. THIS IS REALLY QUICK EASY WAY FOR THIEF GET IN AND ACTUALLY THIEF LOVE SEE THESE BECAUSE HE WALKUP, THROW ROCK THROUGH THIS WINDOW AND REACH IN AND UNLOCK DOOR AND AWAY YOU GO. IN THIS CASE, THIS IS DOOR THAT LEAD FROM GARAGE TO HOUSE. YOUWILL SEE THERE'S NO DEADBOLT. NICE THING IS THAT DOOR FRAME IS BUILT PROPERLY. DRAWBACK IS AS WITH ANY LOCK IF YOU DON'T LOCK IT, IT DOESN'T DO YOU MUCH GOOD. THAT IS ONE OF THINGTHAT I CAN STRESS MOST. WHEN I COME TO HOUSE THAT SOMEBODY HAS LOCKED THEIR KEYIN HOUSE, I CAN ALMOST FIND WINDOW THAT IS CRACKED, DOOR THAT IS OPEN OR SOME WAY OF ENTRY WITHOUT EVEN PICKING LOCK. ONE OF COMMON THINGTHAT I FIND IN HOUSEWHEN I COME TO UNLOCK THEM IS GARAGE.

NEXT STEP WE LOOK AT IS IF THERE ANY CUT EDGES. ON LEATHER IT SHOULD BE ROUGH ON FAKE LEATHER IT SHOULD BE VERY CLEAN CUT. SO THIS FAKE THIS REAL. SO ON THIS WE CAN KIND OF LOOK ON INSIDE OF THIS BOOT UP HERE AROUND CORNER WHERE IT NOT EXACTLY VERY NEAT IT KIND OF GOT WRINKLES AND ROUGHNESS IT NOT TOTALLY CLEAN CUT IT LEATHER ITS PIECE Y LITTLE BIT. THINGS LIKE THIS BOOT LEATHER CUTS ARE REALLY JUST AS CLEAN AS IF THEY WERE PLASTIC AND THAT HOW YOU CAN TELL NOT REAL LEATHER. SO THIS BEEN HOW YOU CAN TELL REAL LEATHER FROM FAKE LEATHER. SO FIRST TIP WE GOING DO AND THIS SEEM REALLY EASY AND ITS ACTUALLY NOT ALWAYS POSSIBLE BUT JUST LOOK AT LABEL SEE IF IT SAY LEATHER. FOR THINGS LIKE BOOTS A LOT OF TIMES YOU FIND IT RIGHT HERE ON SOLE. FOR NEWER BOOTS YOU FIND IT INSIDE USUALLY ON TAG SOMETIMES LIKE THAT ONE OR YOU MIGHT ALSO FIND IT ON BOTTOM ON SOLE. SO IF IT NOT SAY LEATHER ON IT 100 PERCENT LEATHER SOMETIMES IT MIGHT SAY LEATHER UPPERS WHICH WOULD MEAN TOPS LEATHER NOT SOLE THAT WAY YOU KNOW IT LEATHER. SO THESE ARE BOTH VINTAGE THESE ARE OLD THEY NOT HAVE THOSE LABELS ANYMORE SO LETS TAKE NEXT STEP. NOW THIS ONE KIND OF GROSSES ME OUT LITTLE BIT BUT IT GREAT WAY TO TELL WHETHER ITS REALLY LEATHER OR NOT AND THAT TAKE REALLY CLOSE LOOK AT SKIN AND LOOK FOR PORES. AND THESE ARE JUST LIKE PORES THAT YOU SEE IN OUR SKIN THE LITTLE HOLES THAT ARE IN YOUR SKIN THAT LET IT BREATHE JUST LIKE US COWS AND ALL OTHER ANIMALS YOU MIGHT MAKE LEATHER OUT OF HAVE PORES IN THEIR SKIN.

RE-MEM-BER IF YOU ARE AL-LER-GIC TO SHELL FISH THIS ISN'T A GOOD MOVE CRAW FISH ARE IN FRESH WA-TER SO YOU CAN EAT THEM WITH-OUT ANY OF THE PROB-LEMS YOU HAVE WITH SHRIMP.

AS WE BRING IT IN, WE ARE GOING TO PULL ALL THE WAY BACK UNTIL THE NEEDLE SLIGHTLY POKES OUT FROM THE FRONT OF THE NEEDLE JUST A LITTLE BIT. ONE LITTLE TATTOO SECRET IS, WHEN YOU PULL THE NEEDLE OUT OF THE PACKAGE, IT IS GOING TO BE STRAIGHT. WITH THE NEEDLE DOWN, YOU ARE GOING TO WANT TO SLIGHTLY BEND IT SO IT IS ARCED SLIGHTLY, AND I WILL EXPLAIN RIGHT NOW WHY THAT IS. HERE IS OUR TATTOO MACHINE.

NOW IT IS STATIONARY; IT CAN'T REALLY WIGGLE AROUND. NOW YOU CAN SEE THAT IT IS ARCED DOWN.

ANYWHERE FROM ABOUT 80 TO 100 APPROPRIATE FOR MOST GLAZES, 50 MIGHT NOT BE FINE-ENOUGH, AND YOU NOT-WANT TO GO TOO MUCH THINNER THAN 100, BECAUSE SOME-OF YOUR MATERIALS MIGHT NOT BE SMALL-ENOUGH TO GO THROUGH. SO YOU GOING TO MIX, JUST STIR UP AGAIN, FEEL BOTTOM, YOU WANT TO HAVE LARGE SPOON. MAKE SURE THERE-NOT BE BIG CHUNKS KIND-OF LAYING-IN WEIGHT DOWN THERE. AND THEN YOU-TAKE A PITCHER, AND GET A SCOOP, POUR IT RIGHT-INTO YOUR SIEVE. AND THEN WITH THIS-ONE YOU JUST TURN BRUSHES, AND THAT PUSHES MATERIALS THROUGH SCREEN. IF YOU NOT-HAVE A BIG FANCY ONE LIKE THIS WITH BRUSHES, MANY-TIMES WEAR RUBBER CLOVE AND JUST KIND-OF USE YOUR HAND TO WORK MATERIALS THROUGH SCREEN THAT WORKS ALSO.

      "484: NOW WE-RE GOING-TO DECORATE OUR BOAT. WE-RE GOING-TO-BE DECORATING THE BOAT WITH PERMANENT MARKER BECAUSE WE DON-T WANT ANY OF THE COLORS TO RUN WHEN THE BOAT GOES INTO THE WATER. THE NEXT DECORATION WE WANT TO-DO IS WE-RE GOING-TO GO TO THE BASE OF THE BOAT AND WE-RE GOING-TO MAKE KIND OF A LINE DOWN WHICH WILL KIND OF LOOK LIKE THE RIM. I GUESS LIKE THE RUBBER BOARDER THAT GOES AROUND THE BOAT SO IT DOESN-T BANG INTO ANYTHING WHEN IT COMES CLOSE TO THE DOCK OR WHEN IT GETS TIED UP. SO, WE-LL PUT A LINE AROUND THE BORDER, AROUND THE BASE OF THE BOAT AND IT WON-T JUST BE ONE LINE WE-LL ACTUALLY FILL IN SOME OTHER COLORS TO MAKE IT STAND OUT A LITTLE MORE. THIS IS REALLY THE KEY TO THIS ONE DECORATION IS KIND OF THE KEY TO MAKING IT KIND OF STAND OUT AND LOOK LIKE A, SOMEWHAT OF A REAL BOAT. THIS IS REALLY, EVEN THOUGH IT MAY NOT REALIZE IT, THIS REALLY STANDS OUT ON BOATS THAT YOU HAVE THAT THICK BORDER GOING AROUND THE BASE. SO, THIS WILL HELP US MAKE IT REALLY LOOK MORE AUTHENTIC. WE-LL PUT OUR FIRST COLOR AROUND, WE USED A RED. WE-LL GO AHEAD AND TAKE A SECOND COLOR AND COMPLETE THE SHAPE TO IT. SO WE-VE MADE TWO LINES AND WE-VE MADE A WAVED LINE GOING DOWN THE MIDDLE. NOW, THE FRONT OF OUR BOAT NEEDS TO HAVE A WINDOW SO WE-LL USE OUR THIN MARKER TO MAKE OUR BORDER. THE FIRST THING WE-RE GOING-TO-DO IS OUTLINE DIFFERENT SHAPES ON THE BOAT. YOU CAN EXPERIMENT WITH SOME DIFFERENT MARKERS. THE LINES COME OUT NOT AS DARK WHEN YOU-RE USING MAKERS AS OPPOSED TO IF YOU WERE GOING-TO USE SOME PAINT. A TYPE OF PAINT THAT IS GOOD FOR IT IS, LIKE WE SAID EARLIER, THE TYPE OF PAINT WOULD BE THE SAME PAINT THAT-S USED TO DECORATE CLOTH LIKE A T-SHIRT BECAUSE THAT-S THE TYPE OF PAINT THAT YOU CAN THROW IN THE WASHING MACHINE AND IT DOESN-T COME OFF. OF COURSE WHEN OUR BOAT IS PLACED IN THE WATER WE WANT THE PAINT TO STAY ON AS WELL. SO, THE PAINT WOULD DEFINITELY GIVE IT MORE OF A STRONGER EFFECT BUT WE ALSO WANTED TO SHOW YOU THAT MOST PEOPLE HAVE THESE MARKERS AROUND THEIR HOUSE AND WE WANTED TO MAKE THE PROJECT AS PRACTICAL AS POSSIBLE TO SHOW YOU THAT IT CAN ALSO BE DONE WITH THESE MARKERS. I-LL PUT A LITTLE DECORATION ON THE FLAG, WE-LL JUST PUT A STAR. YOU CAN PUT YOUR FAMILY INSIGNIA IF YOU HAVE ONE. AND HERE, WE SEE THAT ONCE THE BOAT IS PLACED INTO WATER IT ACTUALLY DOES FLOAT. SO IT-S A REALLY NICE PROJECT FOR KIDS AND THEY COME OUT WITH A NICE TOY THAT THEY CAN PLAY WITH AT BATH TIME. IF YOU-RE GOING-TO PUT IT INTO THE BATH THE GLUE AND THE COLOR SHOULD HOLD, BUT I WOULD TAKE OUT THE TOOTHPICK, OBVIOUSLY MIGHT BE A BIT OF A SAFETY HAZARD. FOR OUR DESIGN WE-RE GOING-TO-BE MAKING SOME WINDOWS ON THE TOP LAYER. BUT THEY CAN HAVE A LOT OF FUN WITH THE BOAT, SOAK IT UP WITH WATER, WATCH IT GO UNDER, COME UP AGAIN, AND IT-S A LOT OF FUN. SO, USE THE BLACK, THIN MARKER. PERMANENT MARKER. WE MADE OUR OUTLINE AND NOW WE-RE GOING-TO FILL IT IN WITH SOME COLORS. I-M USING A BLUE COLOR NOW. WE GO AHEAD AND DO THE OTHER SIDE THE SAME WITH THE WINDOWS. IT-S EASIER TO OUTLINE EVERYTHING FIRST SO WHEN YOU DRAW, PUT THE ACTUAL COLORS ON, THEY KEEP THEIR SHAPE AND ALSO THE BORDER AROUND THE DIFFERENT SHAPES GIVES A NICE, MAKES IT STAND OUT A LITTLE MORE, GIVES A NICE AFFECT TO IT, HAS A NICE TOUCH.\n",

PANTS ARE REALLY FUN TO MODEL BECAUSE THE LONGER THE LEG, AND MOST PRINT MODELS HAVE NICE LONG LEGS, YOU REALLY GET TO SHOW OFF THE PANT LEG. WE WANT TO SHOW THE FLARE IF IT'S NARROW AT THE BOTTOM OR FLARED AT THE BOTTOM. WE ALSO WANT TO SHOW ANY DESIGNS THAT ARE ON THE PANTS. SO IN POSE 15, YOU CAN SHOW THE SLEEVES AND THE PANTS PARTICULARLY WELL WITH A VERY BROAD POSE.

WHEN I GOT TO THE LAKE THIS MORNING, I IMMEDIATELY LOOKED AROUND AND SAID, THIS LOOKS LIKE A SKATING RINK. THEN WHEN YOU WALK, THIS WILL GIVE YOU THE STABILITY THAT YOU NEED. YOU DON'T SLIP; IT GRIPS VERY, VERY WELL, AND IT WILL KEEP YOU FROM GETTING INJURED OR FROM DAMAGING YOUR EQUIPMENT. THIS ICE IS SLICK.

AGAIN, THESE SIT ON THE BOTTOM OF YOUR BOOT SO THAT THEY COME IN CONTACT WITH THE ICE AND GIVE YOU SOME STABILITY. THERE'S ANOTHER TYPE THAT SIMPLY HAS A CLIP AND A STRAP, AND ALL YOU DO IS CAREFULLY PUT THAT OVER. MAKE SURE THAT THE BOTTOM OF IT IS FACING DOWNWARD, AND THEN YOU JUST CINCH IT UP AS TIGHT AS YOU CAN, AGAIN MAKING CERTAIN, AS YOU CAN SEE, THAT IT'S ON THE BOTTOM OF YOUR BOOT.\n",

SAY, FROM MOVING IT FROM ONE LOCATION TO ANOTHER. MARVEL AID WORKS REAL WELL FOR MINOR THINGS. BUT THERE IS NOTHING THAT CAN BEAT INTELLIGENCE AND KNOWLEDGE OF AVIAN VET WHEN YOU HAVE SICK BIRD. AND MORE THAN LIKELY, THAT WILL BE ONLY WAY YOU'LL BE ABLE SAVE THAT BIRD. IF YOUR BIRD HAS BEEN EXPOSED TO SMOKE, NEAR FIRE OR ANYWHERE WHERE SMOKE HAS GOT TO BIRD, BIRDS CANNOT GET THAT SMOKE OUT OF THEIR LUNGS. THEY MAY GO ON FOR MONTHS AND NEVER SHOW SIGN, AND THEN ALL OF SUDDEN, YOU LOOSE THAT BIRD. FIRES ARE VERY DANGEROUS TO BIRDS, AND, I MYSELF EVEN HAD FIRE IN WHICH I THOUGHT MY BIRDS WERE FINE, AND THEN MONTHS LATER I STARTED LOOSING THEM, AND IT WAS SAID THAT IT WAS DUE TO SMOKE IN THEIR LUNG. THEN BIRD NEEDS WARMTH. USE HEATING PAD, BROODER, ANYTHING THAT YOU CAN TO GET WARMTH TO THAT BIRD. I WOULD SUGGEST HIGHLY THAT WHEN YOU KNOW BIRD IS SICK, THAT YOU SEE, AN AVIAN VET. THEY'RE NOT LOT OF AVIAN VETS AROUND, BUT THERE ARE MANY GOOD ONES AROUND. REASON BEING, THAT BIRD DOES NOT SHOW THAT IT IS SICK, UNTIL IT IS WELL SICK. BECAUSE, THEY ARE ATTUNED TO HIDING ANY ILLNESS AWAY FROM THEIR FLOCK SO THAT THEY WON'T BE BANNED FROM FLOCK. SO, BY TIME YOU CAN SEE THAT BIRD IS SICK, IT HAS BEEN SICK FOR WHILE.
