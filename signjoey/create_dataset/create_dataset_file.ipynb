I am getting a lot of liquid out. Continue to blot until the area is dry. Now, you will find with any spill, especially one of that magnitude, that was quite a bit of liquid that went in there, it goes through the bottom. In this particular case, I feel that it is wet, however, we don't see the color in here. But it is wet. So you just want to blot. And already, already, this carpet sample pretty dry to the touch. Again, the Scotchgard helped us but even a carpet without the Scotchgard, if your carpet is older, its okay. Just this blotting technique really does a lot. So that?s really the most important thing you can do in a spill; is take a white towel and blot it. Take immediate action, got the spill, take immediate action. And be patient. You want it dry as soon as possible. So the other thing I would highly recommend is to take a fan and just put it on the area and let it dry. Now look. Its kind of matted down a little bit from my blotting right? So, just take it, bring that carpet nap up. Bring it back up. And the reason why you want to do that is because then the air flow can get in through this carpet and that you decrease that drying time. You want to get that carpet as dry as possible as quickly as possible. So, good job. First thing is to take a white towel, white cotton tile and blot. Never scrub, never ever scrub. Look what I got just from that blotting right there. And just be patient and blot. Put some muscle in to it. Just continue your blotting. Okay?\n",

      "314: HI. MICHAEL SETO, PROFESSIONAL PHOTOGRAPHER, AND IN THIS CLIP WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT SELECTING AND USING A TRIPOD FOR JEWELRY PHOTOGRAPHY. IT'S A NICE STURDY TRIPOD. IT'S SOMETHING THAT A LOT OF PROFESSIONALS USE. AS WELL, INSTEAD OF JUST THE STANDARD HEAD ON THIS, THIS IS MORE OF A VIDEO HEAD, I USE A BALL HEAD. THIS ONE IS MADE BY REALLY RIGHT STUFF. THEY MAKE SOME FANTASTIC, VERY HIGH QUALITY BALL HEADS, PROBABLY THE CADILLAC OF BALL HEADS AND YOU REALLY NEED ONE OF THESE TO, TO BE ABLE TO TAKE A GOOD SHOT OF A PIECE OF JEWELRY. SO TRIPOD IS IMPORTANT, A NICE HEAVY-DUTY TRIPOD WITH THE GOOD HEAD IS A KEY TO A STABLE CAMERA WHEN DOING JEWELRY PHOTOGRAPHY. FIRST OF ALL, WHEN YOU'RE SHOOTING JEWELRY, WHICH IS A MACRO TYPE SITUATION, MEANING YOU'RE SHOOTING UP CLOSE, YOU ABSOLUTELY NEED A TRIPOD. THERE IS NO WAY YOU'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO SHOOT SOMETHING LIKE THAT AND GET A VERY CLEAR AND SHARP PHOTO WITHOUT USING A TRIPOD, JUST BECAUSE YOU'RE VERY CLOSE TO THE SUBJECT, ANY MOVEMENT WILL BE MAGNIFIED IN THE PHOTOGRAPH. AS WELL, YOU TEND TO SHOOT WITH A SLOWER SHUTTER SPEED SO THAT ALSO EXACERBATES ANY MOVEMENT. SO LET'S LOOK AT A COUPLE OF TRIPODS HERE. YOU CAN GO WITH A VERY BASIC SMALL TRAVEL TRIPOD, THESE ARE FAIRLY ECONOMICAL. THEY COME WITH A LITTLE QUICK DETACH MECHANISM THAT FITS ON THE BOTTOM OF YOUR CAMERA. THESE WILL DO THE JOB IN A PINCH, BUT THEY'RE FAIRLY LIGHT WEIGHT, THEY WILL NOT BE AS STABLE AS A MORE HEAVY-DUTY TRIPOD LIKE THIS ONE. THIS IS A MANFROTTO 055.\n",

BUT LET'S TALK ABOUT THIS PERSON, HOW TO GO FROM THIS TO THIS AND HOW TO FIND THIS, AND WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT THAT NEXT.

AND DO THIS ALL WAY ACROSS NAPKIN AS MUCH SPACE AS YOU WANT. OKAY NOW WHEN YOU HAVE YOUR FOREGROUND CUT OUT. YOU HAVE YOUR NAPKIN CUT YOU. YOU SEE THAT WE TURN ALL OVER NAPKIN INTO NICE PIECE OF SCENERY. AND WE GO GLUE THAT DOWN WITH DECOUPAGE GLUE. YOU NEED FOR THIS PRETTY NAPKIN. OKAY YOU ALWAYS WANT CHECK THAT YOU GOT ALL LAYER OF BACKING OF NAPKIN. AND YOU TAKE IT DOWN UNTIL YOU GET TRANSLUCENT, YOU CAN SEE IT VERY THIN PIECE OF NAPKIN. OKAY NOW TO APPLY OUR NAPKIN WE FIRST GO TAKE DECOUPAGE GLUE AND PUT THIN LAYER OF GLUE ON BOARD. YOU CAN USE YOUR HAND FOR THAT. YOU CAN ALSO USE PAINT BRUSH FOR PUTTING DOWN THAT FIRST THIN LAYER OF GLUE. WHEN YOU APPLY NAPKIN TO GLUE ON TOP THEN YOU WANT USE YOUR FINGER OR YOUR HAND SO YOU CAN FEEL HOW MUCH PRESSURE YOU PUTTING ON NAPKIN. PAINT BRUSH LITTLE BIT TOO ROUGH FOR THAT. OKAY AND THEN ONCE YOU HAVE THAT THIN LAYER OF GLUE YOU WANT VERY CAREFULLY PLACE IT DOWN ON GLUE PATTING IT INTO PLACE. AND DON'T WORRY ABOUT LITTLE BIT OF WRINKLING. THAT NORMAL WITH NAPKIN. ME USING DAISY NAPKIN WITH ALL OVER DESIGN OF FLOWER AND GRASS. AND IT ADD LITTLE BIT OF TEXTURE AND CHARACTER TO DESIGN. SO JUST PAT THAT DOWN GENTLY. AND THEN WE GLAZE IT OVER WITH SOME MORE OF DECOUPAGE GLUE. OKAY. AND WHEN YOU GLUING YOU WANT VERY, VERY GENTLY MAKE SURE YOU HAVE LOT OF GLUE ON YOUR FINGER AND IT SHOULD BE SMOOTH AND SLICK. NOW, ME HAVE GRASS LIKE THIS AND FLOWER PETAL ME WANT TO GLUE IN UPWARD MOTION. YOU DON'T WANT PUSH IT THIS WAY OR YOU MAY TEAR YOUR NAPKIN. AND THEN JUST PUT GOOD LAYER ALL AROUND ON NAPKIN AND LOOK FOR AIR BUBBLE. IF YOU HAVE AIR BUBBLE YOU WANT PUT LITTLE BIT OF GLUE THERE AND KIND OF SQUISH IT OUT. BUT VERY, VERY GENTLY SO YOU DON'T TEAR NAPKIN OR GET HOLE IN YOUR DESIGN. ME USING STICKER BOOK THAT ME PICK UP IN STORE AND DECOUPAGE GLUE. AND YOU NEED SOME SCISSOR FOR CUTTING. OKAY ME GO USE ME DAISY NAPKIN HERE FOR FOREGROUND AND BASE OF LITTLE FAIRY PICNIC. SO TO USE ALL OVER DESIGN LIKE THIS THAT ME ONLY WANT TO HAVE ON BOTTOM HERE TO KIND OF SHOW THAT THEY GO BE SITTING IN GARDEN ME WANT CUT ME NAPKIN.

YOU WANT INSULATE TOP \"A\" FRAME PORTION OF IT AND ALSO YOU WANT INSULATE ACROSS YOUR BEAMS THAT MAKE-YOUR INSIDE CEILING SO YOU-GOT TWO LAYERS OF INSULATION IN CEILING. THAT REALLY HELPS KEEP SOUND FROM GOING UP. ANOTHER CONSIDERATION IS: IF I DO HAVE CEMENT BLOCK WALL CONSTRUCTION ON CEMENT BLOCK SLAB, I-GOT REALLY BE CONCERNED ABOUT MY ROOF BECAUSE THAT IS WHERE ALL MY SOUND IS GOING TO LEAK OUT OF. IF I BUILD STANDARD \"A\" FRAME TYPE ROOF, I-GONNA REALLY WANT INSULATE IT AND DEFINITELY USE 2X6 OR 2X8 CONSTRUCTION. I-HERE TALK TO YOU ABOUT SOUNDPROOFING YOUR RECORDING STUDIO. ON THIS BUILDING I HAVE T-111 SIDING ON OUTSIDE, WHICH IS STANDARD CARDBOARD SIDING THAT YOU WILL FIND ON MANY HOMES. IT-PRETTY GOOD FOR STOPPING SOUND, BUT NOT QUITE AS GOOD AS PLYWOOD WOULD BE. IF I WERE BUILDING THIS HOME FROM GROUND UP, OR I WANTED MAKE THIS BETTER, I WOULD PUT T-111 OVER PLYWOOD AND THEN PUT SHINGLES OVER THAT. BUT I-MORE CONCERNED WITH WORKING ON INSIDE OF MY BUILDING; AND THAT-WHERE I SPENT MY MONEY FOR THIS BUILDING WAS ON INSIDE WALLS. WE-GONNA GO IN THERE AND SHOW YOU LITTLE OF THAT IN MOMENT.

      "395: NOW I-EM READY PUT-PL IMAGES ON-TO OUR SHEET PLASTIC. THE PIECE PLASTIC-THAT WE-ARE USING-IS A THICK PIECE PLASTIC, BUT IT-IS A BIT TRANSLUCENT, SO YOU CAN-SEE THROUGH, AND IT WILL-BE PERFECT FOR GETTING THE IMAGES, PLACING THE SHEET PAPER UNDERNEATH AND GETTING THE IMAGES TO SHOW THROUGH SO THAT WE CAN GO-AHEAD AND TRACE IT ON-TO THE SHEET PLASTIC. DON'T OVERCROWD THE PLASTIC WITH IMAGES, BUT, THEN AGAIN, DON'T LEAVE ANY LARGE OPEN BLANK SPACES. YOU-MIGHT WANT-TO HOLD UP THE PLASTIC SHEET EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE-JUST-TO GET A CLEAR LOOK AT WHERE YOU-HAVE PLACED YOUR IMAGES AND WHICH SPACES ARE STILL LEFT EMPTY. AND ALSO YOU MIGHT WANT-TO FOLD IT UP JUST ALSO TO SEE WHERE THE FASTENERS ARE GOING TO GO SO YOU KNOW WHERE TO PUT AN IMAGE; YOU DON'T WANT-TO CUT OFF AN IMAGE UNDERNEATH THE FOLD. SO, JUST TO GET A CLEAR LOOK, IT-IS GOOD TO STOP EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE AND JUST TAKE A LOOK AT THE SHEET PLASTIC AND SEE WHERE YOUR IMAGES ARE LYING. SO NOW I-HAVE SHOWED YOU HOW-TO TAKE THE IMAGES AND PUT THEM ON-TO THE SHEET PLASTIC, USING THE ORIGINAL WHITE PAPER, THE ORIGINAL WHITE IMAGES, THAT WE DREW. SO I-WILL GO-AHEAD AND DO THAT. FIRST I WANT-TO GET THE RIGHT SIZE OF MY PLASTIC, AND I-AM GOING-TO CUT IT-TO ABOUT TWENTY FOUR TO THIRTY INCHES LONG. SO I CUT OFF THE EXCESS, AND THEN PUT THE PLASTIC OVER THE SHEET PAPER WITH MY IMAGES THAT I DREW, AND I-AM GOING TO ONLY USE THE PENCIL AT THIS POINT, I-AM NOT GOING-TO START USING ANY KIND OF PERMANENT MARKERS YET. BUT I-AM GOING-TO DRAW DIRECTLY ON-TO THE PLASTIC WHERE I SAW THE IMAGES, WHERE THE IMAGES JUST COME THROUGH ON THE BOTTOM, AND I MOVE THE PLASTIC AROUND FROM PLACE-TO-PLACE SO I CAN GET IMAGES ON DIFFERENT ANGLES AND ON DIFFERENT LOCATIONS OF THE PLASTIC. IT DOESN'T HAVE-TO LOOK EXACTLY THE WAY IT LOOKED ON THE PAPER, THOSE ARE JUST MY ORIGINAL IMAGES THAT I WANT-TO APPLY TO THE PLASTIC, BUT NOT IN THE SAME EXACT PLACE. IT-IS MUCH EASIER TO DRAW THE IMAGES ON THE PLASTIC BY USING THIS WHITE PAPER UNDERNEATH, BECAUSE WHEN YOU DRAW ON THE PLASTIC, THIS PLASTIC SHEET THAT WE-ARE USING, YOU DON'T SEE THE IMAGES, YOU CAN'T REALLY SEE THE PENCIL SO CLEARLY. SO IT-IS A LOT EASIER TO HAVE THE IMAGE UNDERNEATH AND THEN JUST TRACE AROUND IT SO YOU DON'T HAVE-TO WORRY ABOUT WHICH LINES YOU MADE AND WHAT LINES YOU DIDN'T MAKE, BECAUSE SOMETIMES YOU MADE A LINE AND YOU DON'T SEE IT SO CLEARLY. AND WE JUST MOVE THE PLASTIC AROUND, MAKING SURE THAT MOST OF THE AREAS ARE COVERED WITH SOME TYPE OF IMAGE.\n",

IN ENGINE TEMPERATURE CAN GET VERY HOT, AND THERE IS FLUID THAT TRAVELS THROUGH MANY HOLES IN ENGINE AND THIS WILL HELP DISSIPATE HEAT. FLUID IS CALLED ANTIFREEZE, ALSO KNOWN AS ENGINE COOLANT. REASON WE USE COOLANT IS BECAUSE, ALTHOUGH WATER WILL DO ABOUT SAME THING, WATER FREEZES WHEN IT GETS TOO COLD AND IT BOILS WHEN IT GETS TOO HOT. BY MIXING ANTIFREEZE WITH WATER, IT WILL LOWER FREEZING POINT AND WILL RAISE BOILING POINT OF LIQUID. BECAUSE ENGINE DOES GET REALLY HOT, WE ADD ANTIFREEZE MIXTURE SO THAT IT WILL HELP PROTECT ENGINE BETTER AND HAVE LESS LIKELIHOOD OF BOILING INSIDE ENGINE.\n",

      "371: HI MY NAME LAUREN TODAY ME HERE DISCUSS HOW BOND HUMAN HAIR. TWO TYPE EXTENSION CAN USE: SYNTHETIC WHICH PROBABLY BE LEAST EXPENSIVE HOWEVER NOT DURABLE AS NATURAL HAIR; NATURAL HAIR EXTENSION MADE OF SAME KERATIN PROTEIN HAIR ACTUALLY MADE OF AND CAN UNDERGO SAME THERMAL TOOL AND STYLING NATURAL HAIR CAN GO THROUGH. BONDING YOU CAN EITHER USE GLUE OR WAX AND WHAT YOU'RE GOING DO IS YOU'RE GOING GRAB SMALL SECTION HAIR AND THEN ADD YOUR PIECE UP AT ROOT HAIR THEN THEY USE PROTEIN BOND OR GLUE IN ORDER BOND THAT PART TO REST HAIR. SO IT BONDED BY ROOT HAIR AND THEN YOU CAN ACTUALLY EITHER ADD LENGTH TO OWN NATURAL HAIR OR YOU CAN ADD VOLUME TO NATURAL HAIR. ACTUAL PROCESS OF BONDING BECAUSE OF SIZE OF SECTION YOU ARE TAKING WHICH ARE VERY VERY SMALL YOU'RE GOING TAKE VERY SMALL BUNCH HAIR IN ORDER CREATE THAT BOND -- IT'S VERY TIME CONSUMING PROCESS AND IT'LL PROBABLY TAKE ANYWHERE FROM THREE TO FIVE HOUR IN ORDER DO ENTIRE HEAD GET DESIRED LENGTH YOU NEED OR DESIRED AMOUNT VOLUME YOU NEED. ANOTHER THING THAT IS TO KNOW ABOUT BONDING HAIR IS THAT YOU ARE HAVE UPKEEP WITH BONDING HAIR. YOU WILL PROBABLY EVERY LIKE TWO TO THREE MONTH HAVE GO BACK TO STYLIST HAVE SOME OF THOSE BOND REMOVED AND THEN REPLACE HAIR. AS HAIR GROW THOSE BOND ALSO GROW DOWN HAIR SHAFT SO YOU DO NEED REPLACE THEM AND THERE IS GOOD AMOUNT UPKEEP AND MAINTENANCE INVOLVED. THAT IS HOW BOND NATURAL HAIR.\n",
      "209: ALTHOUGH YOU MAY COMPETE IN SOME TRIATHLONS, ESPECIALLY IN SPRING THAT HAVE POOL SWIMS, A TRUE TRIATHLON TAKES AN OPEN WATER SWIM. AND THERE ARE SOME SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS WHEN COMPETING IN AN OPEN WATER SWIM. THE POORER SWIMMER YOU ARE, THE MORE YOU'LL GAIN TIME WITH WETSUIT. IF YOU HAVE REALLY GOOD BODY POSITION ALREADY, WETSUIT WON'T PICK UP A LOT OF TIME BUT MOST PEOPLE WILL SEE A THREE TO FIVE SECOND PER HUNDRED IMPROVEMENT AND THAT'S A REALLY NICE THING. ANOTHER NICE THING, OF COURSE IS THAT YOU'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO WEAR WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO RUN AND BIKE IN UNDERNEATH THE WETSUIT AND THEN JUST PEEL IT OFF AND BE READY TO GO. SO EVEN THOUGH YOU'RE GOING TO LOSE A BIT OF TIME TAKING A WETSUIT OFF, YOU GAIN IT BY HAVING THAT GEAR ON UNDERNEATH. SOME OTHER SPECIFICS WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT OPEN WATER SWIMMING IS YOU NEED TO GET USED TO STARTING FAST. IT'S REAL EASY TO GET LULLED INTO THE GROUP YOUR WITH. SO YOU WANT TO GET OFF THE LINE QUICK AND YOU COULD PRACTICE THAT IN SWIMMING BY DOING SOME FAST FIFTIES RIGHT BEFORE YOU DO YOUR LONG SETS OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT TO GET OUT AND THEN QUICKLY SETTLE INTO YOUR RHYTHM. YOU DON'T WANT TO JUST KIND OF EASE INTO THE THING YOU GET INTO A SLOW GROUP. IF YOU HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO GO TO A LAKE TO SWIM WITH A LITTLE TRIATHLON CLUB OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT TO PRACTICE OPEN WATER SWIMMING, IT'S A GREAT THING TO DO. YOU COULD PRACTICE DRAFTING OFF SOMEBODY, WHAT IT'S LIKE TO SWIM RIGHT CLOSE BEHIND AND AGAIN THAT'S JUST BEST EXPERIENCED BY DOING IT. SOME OF THEM YOU CAN ADDRESS IN TRAINING AND SOME OF THEM REALLY JUST NEED TO BE ADDRESSED BY THE EXPERIENCE OF DOING THE RACES. SOME OTHER THINGS YOU CAN PRACTICE IN THE POOL, SIGHTING. IN AN OPEN WATER SWIM, EVERY SIX OR EIGHT STROKES, YOU NEED TO CHOP THE STROKE SHORT AND STICK YOUR HEAD UP. STAYING ON COURSE IS A WHOLE OTHER ASPECT OF OPEN WATER SWIMMING. SO TRY TO PICK SOMETHING ON THE SHORE LINE, NOT THE BUOY THAT YOU'RE SWIMMING FOR, BUT A BOAT RAMP OR A HOME OR LAMP POLE OR SOMETHING SO THAT IF YOU'VE GOT A SEA OF BRIGHT ORANGE CAPS IN FRONT OF YOU, THAT YOU STILL KNOW WHAT YOU'RE SWIMMING FOR. SO THOSE ARE SOME REAL KEY AND SPECIFIC THINGS FOR WHEN YOU TACKLE THAT OPEN WATER SWIM. ONE OF THE MOST BASIC TIPS: PUT ON YOUR GOGGLES, THEN PUT THE CAP ON OVER TOP OF THE GOGGLES AND THAT WAY, IF YOU COLLIDE WITH SOMEBODY AND THEIR HAND DRAGS ALONG YOUR HEAD, IT WON'T RIP YOUR GOGGLES OFF. YOU NEED TO PRACTICE SWIMMING IN YOUR WETSUIT. SWIMMING IN A WETSUIT IS COMPLETELY DIFFERENT THAN SWIMMING WITHOUT ONE. YOU'LL PROBABLY USE ONE TO TWO STROKES LESS PER LENGTH, YOU'LL GLIDE MORE AND YOU'LL RIDE HIGHER IN THE WATER. SO, YOU CAN TAKE IT INTO THE POOL AND SWIM A BIT IN IT JUST TO GET ACCUSTOMED TO IT. IT FEELS VERY DIFFERENT. IT'S VERY EFFICIENT.\n",

I HAVE-HER ACTUALLY TURN-IN THE SAME DIRECTION AS THE FACE-IS, AND HAVING-TO TRY-TO CREATE A MOVEMENT WITH-HER.

COMING RIGHT-AT YOU. AND THEN ONE GOING BACK. SO YOU CAN TELL HERE THIS ARM IS BIGGER THAN THIS ONE HERE. SO IT GIVES IT A LITTLE BIT MORE UNDERSTANDING THAT YOU'RE ACTUALLY RIGHT THERE WITH-THEM.

YOU MIGHT WONDER WHEN YOU SEE CARICATURES IN A THEME PARK OR AT THE PIER SOMEWHERE, HOW DO THEY FIGURE-OUT HOW-TO PUT THE BODY'S ON THESE CARICATURES, AND HOW THEY FIGURE HOW-TO DO THE DIFFERENT POSES FOR THEM. WELL OBVIOUSLY WHAT I DREW FOR THESE TWO PEOPLE HERE, THEY DIDN'T HAVE THESE POSES LIKE THIS. SO I TRY-TO THINK ABOUT HOW THERE PERSONALITIES ARE, AND THEY TELL ME ABOUT WHAT THEY LIKE, AND SOMETIMES YOU JUST ASK THE CLIENT WHAT ARE THE KINDS OF THINGS THAT YOU'RE INTERESTED IN. AND USUALLY THEY WOULD TELL YOU, \"OH I LOVE WONDER WOMAN,\" OR \"I LOVE SUPERMAN.\" OKAY YOU CAN GO-FROM THERE AND ILLUSTRATE THAT. SO HOW AM I GOING-TO CREATE WONDER WOMAN IN HER POSE.

      "368: HI I'M DIANA KORTEN AND I'M HERE TODAY WITH BEN TO TALK ABOUT COMMON CAT ILLNESSES. I'VE CHOSEN BEN TO DO THIS SEGMENT WITH US BECAUSE HE GETS URINARY TRACT INFECTIONS PRETTY EASILY. I'M JUST FILLING THIS BOX WITH THE HEALTH CHECK LITTER AND WHAT WILL HAPPEN IS WHEN THE CAT GOES TO THE BATHROOM IT WILL JUST BE YELLOW. IF THE CAT PEES AND IT STAYS YELLOW THEN THAT IS A SIGN THAT THINGS ARE PROBABLY OKAY. IF THE COLOR CHANGES AND YOU GET A RED, THAT USUALLY TELLS YOU THAT THERE IS A LITTLE URINE IN THE BLOOD AND YOU WANT TO GET HE CAT TO HAVE IT CHECKED OUT. BEN IS BEING VERY COOPERATIVE TODAY AND WE'RE GOING TO SEE HOW HIS URINE COMES OUT. IT IS LOOKING VERY YELLOW AND IT IS JUST LOOKING VERY YELLOW SO THAT TELLS US THAT BEN IS DOING VERY WELL TODAY. IF IT CHANGED COLOR THEN THAT WOULD TELL US THAT WE NEED TO BE ON THE LOOK OUT AND WE NEED TO TAKE HIM TO THE VET. THE REASON WHY WE ARE IN THE BATHROOM TODAY IS THAT FOR SOME REASON CATS ARE DRAWN TO THE BATHROOM WHEN THEY'RE NOT FEELING WELL. A CAT WITH A URINARY TRACT INFECTION WILL OFTEN PEE RIGHT OVER THE DRAIN SO IF YOU COME IN THE BATHROOM AND YOU SMELL A LITTLE CAT URINE ODOR OR YOU SEE A LITTLE YELLOW AROUND THE DRAIN THAT IS A GOOD SIGN THAT YOUR CAT MIGHT HAVE A URINARY TRACT INFECTION AND YOU WANT TO RUSH HIM TO THE VET BECAUSE THEY CAN DIE FROM UTI'S. SOME WAYS THAT YOU CAN HELP YOUR CAT PREVENT FROM GETTING UTI'S AND KIDNEY FAILURE IS TO KEEP THEM WELL HYDRATED. I WOULD LIKE TO ADVOCATE FEEDING YOUR CAT WET FOOD WHICH CONTAINS A LOT OF WATER. BASICALLY YOU WANT TO WATCH FOR THINGS LIKE LOSS OF APPETITE. CATS ARE NOT NATURAL DRINKERS. OCCASIONALLY YOU WILL GET A CAT WHO LOVES TO DRINK A LOT OF WATER BUT MOST CATS AREN'T REALLY GOOD WATER DRINKERS. THEY ARE ORIGINALLY A DESERT ANIMAL. THEIR ANCESTORS GOT MOST OF THEIR MOISTURE FROM THEIR KILL SO GIVING THEM A WET DIET MEANS THAT THEY GET A LOT OF MOISTURE IN THEIR FOOD LIKE THEIR ANCESTORS DID. FROM DAY ONE YOU WANT TO TAKE YOUR CAT IN FOR AN ANNUAL HEALTH CHECK, EVEN IF THERE IS NOTHING GOING ON. ONCE YOUR CAT GETS TO BE EIGHT YEARS OLD YOU REALLY WANT TO TAKE THAT CAT IN ONCE EVERY SIX MONTHS TO GET A LITTLE BLOOD WORK DONE, GET THESE THINGS CHECKED OUT BECAUSE A LOT OF THINGS, THERE ARE A LOT OF ILLNESSES THAT YOUR VET CAN CATCH EARLY THAT DON'T HAVE TO BE TERMINAL BUT IF YOU CATCH THEM LATE, IF YOU WAIT FOR YOUR CAT TO POINT YOU TO THE SYMPTOMS, YOU MAY FIND THAT BY THAT TIME IT IS REALLY TOO LATE. YOU WANT TO CHECK THEIR FUR AND IF THEIR FUR GETS DEHYDRATED. YOU WANT TO PULL ON IT LIKE THIS AND YOU SEE HOW BEN'S JUST SORT OF POPS BACK DOWN. IF YOU PULL ON IT LIKE THIS IT WILL STAY UP IF THEY'RE DEHYDRATED AND THAT TELLS YOU THAT SOMETHING IS GOING ON. HIDING IS ANOTHER SYMPTOM. THEY ARE TRYING TO HIDE THEIR ILLNESS SO THEY TRY TO HIDE THEIR WHOLE SELVES. FORTUNATELY WE HAVE SOME TOOLS THAT CAN HELP US AS WELL. IF YOUR CAT IS GETTING A LITTLE BIT OLDER YOU MIGHT WANT TO CONSIDER USING A DIAGNOSTIC LITTER PERIODICALLY JUST AS A ROUTINE CHECK TO MAKE SURE THAT THE CAT IS NOT ILL.\n",

SMALLEST JUMP RING, THESE ARE ABOUT EIGHT-MILLIMETER. AND FOUR ROUNDED-HEAD PIN AND YOU NEED OF COURSE SWAROVSKI CRYSTAL, SIZE KNOWN AS TWENTY-FOUR PP.

IN ADDITION TO WIRE CUTTER THAT YOU NEED FOR CUTTING CHAIN, YOU NEED TWO PAIR OF FLAT-NOSE PLIER AND PAIR OF NEEDLE-NOSE PLIER, IN ORDER TO WORK WITH NECKLACE. YOU WILL NEED SPECIAL GLUE CALLED STRASS 244, WHICH IS FOR GLUEING ON CRYSTAL. AND IT ADVISABLE TO HAVE Q-TIP AT YOUR DISPOSAL AND LITTLE BIT OF WATER. YOU NEED A SIXTEENTH CENTIMETERS OF ANTIQUE-COPPER CHAIN. IT SMALL CHAIN, IT NOT TOO BULKY. YOU COULD USE, THAT ABOUT FOUR INCH, OBVIOUSLY THIS DEPEND ON HOW LONG YOU WISH TO WEAR YOUR NECKLACE, SO YOU COULD START WITH IT LITTLE BIT LONGER THEN CUT IT SHORTER AT END. YOU CUT CHAIN, CHAIN IS SOLD IN LONG SPOOL AND YOU CUT IT USING PAIR OF WIRE CUTTER. NEVER CUT CHAIN WITH SCISSOR BECAUSE IT BREAK SCISSOR, THAT BY WAY.

WE HAVE TO INSTALL THE SILENCERS THAT CAME ON THE USED ONES, I'M TRANSFERRING ONTO THE NEW ONES BECAUSE IT DIDN'T COME EQUIP WITH THOSE. AND YOU REMEMBER THERE IS TWO DISTINCTIVELY DIFFERENT STYLE SILENCERS USED. THE OUTBOARD PAD HAD THE WIDE FINGERS OF THE OUTER SIDE OF CALIPER FOR SEALING SO I USED THE WIDE FINGER. DO YOU TO SEE WHERE IT IS SEALED ON BEFORE, THAT'S THE OUTBOARD PAD THAT APPLIES JUST TO THAT. THIS IS THE INBOARD PAD WHERE THE PISTON APPLIES PRESSURE AGAINST THE BRAKE PAD AND THAT'S DONE IN THE CENTER. NOW, YOU WANT THESE TABS TO BE SECURELY MOUNTED, THE WAY TO DO SO IS YOU TAKE A LARGE PAIR OF CHANNEL LOCK PLIERS AND YOU JUST ADJUST THEM FOR COMFORTABLE GRIP ACROSS THE PAD AND YOU JUST SQUEEZE ON. THERE'S TWO TABS ON ONE SIDE, ONE IN THE CENTER, JUST SQUEEZE AND LOCK THOSE DOWN ALL THREE TABS, AND THAT SECURES THE BRAKE SILENCER TO THE PAD. AND JUST AS SAFE AS YOU DO AGAIN WITH THE OTHER BRAKE PAD, AND IT'S SECURE. NOW, WE CAN INSTALL THE PADS INTO THE CALIPER MOUNTING BRACKET. PRIOR TO DOING SO, WHERE THE PADS SLIDE BACK AND FORTH IN THE CALIPER ASSEMBLIES, WE WANT TO MAKE SURE AND LUBRICATE THAT AREA. YOU'VE GOT TWO PADS FOR EACH SIDE OF THE VEHICLE. WE WANT TO USE A VERY SMALL AMOUNT OF LUBRICANT BECAUSE WE DON'T WANT AN EXCESS TO GET ON THE PADS OR AROUND IN THE BRAKE SYSTEM, JUST ADEQUATE TO LUBRICATE THE SYSTEM. PLEASE WATCH OUR NEXT SEGMENT AND WE'LL COVER INSTALLING THE PADS PART 2. AS YOU'VE NOTICED, THERE IS THE DIFFERENCE IN TWO OF THE PADS. TWO PADS ARE IDENTICAL. THAT'S THE OUTBOARD PAD ON EACH SIDE AND THE TWO INBOARD PADS ARE INVERTED SO THAT THE WARNING TAB IS LOCATED IN CORRECT POSITION. SO IF YOU TAKE THE BRAKE PADS, YOU JUST REMOVE AND MATCH THEM UP. THESE TWO MATCHED. THIS IS MY INBOARD ONE. BOTH OUTBOARD PADS ARE IDENTICAL FOR SIDES SO JUST SELECT ONE, NOW I HAVE MY 2 PADS.\n",

AND WHAT JAPANESE DO IS AFTER THEY PICK TEA LEAVES THEY STEAM THE TEA LEAVES INCREASING THE CORAFIL. THEREFORE WHEN YOU LOOK AT JAPANESE GREEN TEA IT IS GREENER THAN CHINESE GREEN TEA. FROM SENCHA THE LEADER PICKING IS CALLED BANCHA AND WHAT THEY DO IS THEY TAKE BANCHA AND THEY ROAST IT IT'S CALLED HOJICHA WHICH IS ROASTED TEA. AND THE BANCHA AS WELL THEY ADD RICE KERNELS AND THEY CALL THAT GENMAICHA WHICH IS MADE FROM AGAIN SAME STYLE TEA IT'S JUST WHEN IT'S PICKED. THEREFORE WHEN YOU THINK OF JAPANESE GREEN TEA IT'S ONE BASIC STYLE OF TEA THAT HAS BEEN MANIPULATED TO CREATE THE DIFFERENT STYLES THE DIFFERENT FLAVORS OF JAPANESE GREEN TEA. JAPANESE GREEN TEA STARTS WITH A BUSH. IT'S ABOUT 3 FEET HIGH AND IT'S PICKED 4 TIMES TO 5 TIMES MOST THROUGH OUT THE YEAR. AND IT STARTS IN THE EARLY SPRING ABOUT APRIL OR SO DEPENDING AGAIN ON THE WEATHER PATTERN. AND THAT SPECIFIC TEA IS CALLED SINCHA VERY FIRST PICKING OF THE YEAR. AND THAT STYLE TYPE OF TEA ONLY LASTS ABOUT 7 TO 10 DAYS MAX. AFTER THAT THEY HAVE ANOTHER PICKING AND THAT STYLE TEA IS CALLED SENCHA. MOST OF THE TEA CONSUMED IN JAPAN IS CALLED SENCHA.

IT'S ALL MIXED PRETTY GOOD. IF YOU SHAKE IT TOO MUCH, IT ACTUALLY HEATS UP THE MOLECULES AND SPEEDS UP THE COLOR PROCESS. SO, IT DOESN'T PROCESS PROPERLY. SO, JUST A LIGHT SHAKE.

BUT ONCE YOU GET IT, YOU CAN ACTUALLY HAVE A LOT OF POWER COMING OUT OF A 720, AND IT'S A REALLY COOL KICK THAT YOU'D USE IN PERFORMANCES AND SHOWS. THERE'S 2 TYPES OF 720S: THERE'S A CHEAT 720 AND A REGULAR 720, OKAY? A CHEAT 720 IS WHERE YOU JUMP OFF ONE FOOT AND YOU DO ABOUT 1 1/2 ROTATIONS, OVER A LITTLE BIT 1 1/2 INTO A KICK, OKAY? SO ONE JUMP, 1 1/2 ROTATION, THEN TO A KICK, AND THEN GO ALL THE WAY AROUND INTO A PUNCH. AND THEN A REGULAR 720 IS YOU JUMP TWO ROTATIONS IN THE AIR, AND YOU'RE GOING TO THROUGH A HOOK KICK OUT OF IT OR A CRESCENT KICK, OKAY? SO A REGULAR 720 IS OFF BOTH LEGS AND A CHEAT 720 IS OFF ONE LEG. ALL-RIGHT. SO NOW A 720 WAS INVENTED BY A MARTIAL ARTIST FOR A COMPETITION AND JUST--IT'S A REALLY SHOWY KICK, BUT IT CAN BE ALSO BE VERY POWERFUL. YOU CAN ALSO HIT A TARGET OR HIT AN OPPONENT WITH IT AND IT CAN BE A KNOCKOUT KICK OR A VERY FORCEFUL KICK.\n",

YOU ALSO WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT ALONG WITH ALL YOUR DECORATIVE SCISSORS, YOU HAVE JUST A REGULAR PAIR OF SCISSORS FOR ANY OTHER CUTTING YOU MIGHT WANT TO DO. A LOT OF SCRAPPERS WILL HAVE A CUTTING SYSTEM WHERE YOU HAVE DIFFERENT UTENSILS THAT YOU USE TO CUT DIFFERENT SHAPES. THE EASIEST WAY TO ORGANIZE THESE IS JUST TO FIND A SMALL CONTAINER WHERE YOU CAN STACK ALL THESE AND YOUR LITTLE CUTTING BLADES. IN THIS SERIES OF CLIPS, I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU HOW TO ORGANIZE YOUR VARIOUS SCRAPBOOK SUPPLIES. DECORATIVE SCISSORS ARE REALLY FUN TO USE WHEN SCRAPBOOKING AND THEY REALLY ADD A GREAT EXTRA FLARE TO ANY PAGE. THE PROBLEM IS WHAT TO DO WITH ALL THOSE SCISSORS THAT YOU ACCUMULATE. IF YOU HAVE A BUNCH OF SCRAPBOOK SCISSORS THAT YOU BOUGHT SEPARATELY, PROBABLY ONE OF THE BEST WAYS TO ORGANIZE THOSE IS JUST TO BUY A PLASTIC CONTAINER LIKE THIS AND PUT ALL OF YOUR SCISSORS IN THERE. THAT WAY YOU CAN JUST DUMP THEM ALL IN THERE AND DIG THROUGH THEM AS YOU NEED THEM. IF YOU DON'T HAVE THAT MANY, YOU CAN ALWAYS JUST USE A DRAWER TRAY LIKE THIS, WHICH IS REALLY NICE BECAUSE YOU CAN JUST SLIDE IT IN A DRAWER AND OUT OF SIGHT OUT OF MIND WHEN YOU'RE NOT SCRAPBOOKING. IF YOU BUY ALL OF YOUR SCISSORS TOGETHER, A LOT OF TIMES THEY'LL COME IN AN ORGANIZER ALL READY. THIS ONE'S REALLY NICE BECAUSE IT SPINS AND YOU CAN SEE ALL OF THE DIFFERENT CUTS THAT IT MAKES ALREADY ON THE SCISSORS.\n",

      "303: ONE OF-THE QUICKEST WAY TO LEARN HOW TO JUMP ROPE, I'LL-HAVE A LOT OF NEW PEOPLE COME IN AND THEY'LL-SAY I HAVEN'T JUMP ROPE SINCE I WAS A KID OR I'VE-NEVER JUMP ROPE, AND I'LL-SEE THEM OVER IN THE CORNER STRUGGLING WITH THEIR JUMP ROPING. AND OTHER PEOPLE COME IN AND THEY ALREADY KNOW HOW TO JUMP ROPE AND THEY'RE-DOING GREAT AND YOU-KNOW, PEOPLE ARE-WATCHING EACH OTHER. AND THEN AT SOME POINT YOU CAN DO-THE TWICE ON ONE FOOT, TWICE ON THE OTHER, AND BREATH. BUT MAKE-SURE YOUR HANDS ARE NOT GOING INTO BIG CIRCLE, OK? MAKE-SURE YOUR FEET ARE NOT GOING WAY UP AND A GOOD PLACE TO DO-THIS IS ACTUALLY IN THE MIRROR. ONCE YOU-DO THAT FOR A TWO MINUTE ROUND, IN FACT I'VE-EVEN HAD SOME-OF THE KIDS DOING THEM FOR THREE TWO MINUTE ROUNDS, BECAUSE YOU'LL ACTUALLY GET THE SAME WORKOUT WITHOUT THE JUMP ROPE ANYWAY, BUT YOU LOOK KIND-OF FOOLISH SOMETIMES WHEN THE OTHER BOXERS ARE-LOOKING AT YOU AND YOU DON'T HAVE A JUMP ROPE AND YOU'RE STILL JUMPING. BUT THE BEST WAY TO LEARN HOW TO JUMP ROPE, TAKE-THE JUMP ROPE, SET IT ASIDE, GO THROUGH THE MOTION. YOU CAN DO-IT RIGHT IN THE MIRROR SO YOU CAN SEE YOURSELF. UP-AND DOWN, TRY-IT, I'LL-BET YOU'LL BE SURPRISED. BUT WITH THE PEOPLE THAT ARE-HAVING TROUBLE, I TELL-THEM COME ON OVER HERE AND BRING YOUR JUMP ROPE AND THEN I-SAY OK, LET-ME SHOW YOU HOW TO JUMP ROPE. SO THEY HAND-ME THEIR JUMP ROPE AND I TAKE-THE JUMP ROPE AND I-SAY THE BEST WAY, AND THEY THINK THEY'RE GOING TO SEE-ME JUMP ROPE, WRONG. WHAT I-DO IS, I TAKE-THE JUMP ROPE AND I SAY THE FIRST THING YOU-DO IS YOU TAKE YOUR JUMP ROPE AND YOU SET IT ASIDE, OK? JUST GET RID-OF THE JUMP ROPE COMPLETELY FOR-A MINUTE. NOW WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO DO IS YOU'RE GOING TO GET IN A POSITION FOR JUMP ROPING AND YOU'RE GOING TO MAKE BELIEVE YOU HAVE A JUMP ROPE, OK? SO WE'RE GOING TO START HOPPING ON THE TWO FEET AND WE'RE GOING TO MAKE OUR HANDS GO DOWN IN THAT SLOW CIRCLE. AS YOUR HANDS GO DOWN, YOUR FEET COME UP, OK? AND JUST MAKE BELIEVE YOU'VE-GOT A JUMP ROPE, OK?\n",

HOWEVER, SINCE HE ENTERED IN WATER, HE HAS TO STOP BECAUSE THAT IS THE RULE WITH WATER. NOW, ON THE OTHER HAND, HE MOVE 1, 2 AND BE IN SWAMP WATER AND HE CONTINUE -- CAN CONTINUE MOVING OUT HIS TURN. SWAMP WATER DOES NOT HAVE THE STIPULATION THAT HE HAS TO STOP SO HE CAN CONTINUE MOVING ON.

      "118: HI ME NAME IS DEAN HALE AND TODAY ME GO GIVE YOU GENERAL OVERVIEW OF HOW PLAY AMERICAN CLASSIC, POKER. NOW DIFFERENT PEOPLE THINK OF POKER AS DIFFERENT GAMES. SO IT TWO CARDS SAME NUMBER AND ANOTHER TWO CARDS OF SAME NUMBER, THAT TWO PAIR. NEXT AFTER THAT WOULD BE THREE OF KIND OR WHAT SOME PEOPLE CALL SET. SET WOULD SIMPLY BE THREE CARDS OF SAME NUMBER IN HAND. AFTER THREE OF KIND WOULD BE STRAIGHT. STRAIGHT IS ANY FIVE CARDS IN SEQUENTIAL ORDER OF DIFFERENT SUITS. AFTER STRAIGHT YOU WOULD HAVE FLUSH. FLUSH IS FIVE CARDS OF SAME SUIT WHETHER IT BE HEARTS, DIAMONDS, SPADES OR CLUBS IN NON-SEQUENTIAL ORDER. AFTER FLUSH, NEXT HIGHEST HAND VALUE WOULD BE CALLED FULL HOUSE OR WHAT SOME POKER PLAYERS REFER TO AS BOAT. AND THAT IS SIMPLY THREE CARDS OF SAME NUMBER AND THEN TWO CARDS OF SAME NUMBER. SO FOR INSTANCE BEST FULL HOUSE YOU COULD HAVE WOULD BE THREE ACES AND TWO KINGS, THAT WOULD BE CALLED ACES OVER KINGS. TODAY TEXAS HOLD 'EM IS PROBABLY MOST POPULAR GAME THAT PEOPLE THINK OF WHEN THEY PLAY POKER. AFTER FULL HOUSE YOU WOULD HAVE FOUR OF KIND, SIMPLY AS IT STATES, YOU HAVE FOUR CARDS OF SAME NUMBER. TWO HANDS THAT BEAT FOUR OF KIND WOULD BE STRAIGHT FLUSH OR ROYAL FLUSH. ROYAL FLUSH IS TEN, JACK, QUEEN, KING, ACE IN ORDER OF SAME SUIT AND THAT IS BEST HAND IN POKER. ME NAME IS DEAN HALE AND ME JUST TAUGHT YOU BASICS ON HOW PLAY POKER. BUT THERE ARE GAMES THAT HAVE STOOD TEST OF TIME SUCH AS FIVE CARD DRAW, FIVE CARD STUD, OMAHA, SEVEN CARD STUD, OMAHA HI-LO, LIST GO ON AND ON. ESSENTIAL THING YOU NEED KNOW TO LEARN HOW PLAY POKER IS STARTING VALUE OF EACH HAND. STARTING VALUE RANGES FROM HIGH CARD ALL WAY TO ROYAL FLUSH AND THEN THERE RANKINGS IN BETWEEN. HIGH CARD IS SIMPLY AS IT STATES, ACE WHEN YOU CONSIDER HIGH CARD IS LISTED AS HIGH CARD. NEXT RANKING WOULD BE PAIR, THAT WOULD BE ANY TWO CARDS THAT ARE OF SAME NUMBER. NEXT RANKING AFTER THAT WOULD BE TWO PAIR, THAT WOULD BE TWO CARDS OR FOUR CARDS THAT HAVE SAME NUMERICAL VALUE OF OTHER ONE. SO ME MAY HAVE MADE THAT LITTLE CONFUSING, LET JUST SAY IF YOU HAVE TWO THREES AND TWO NINES, THAT WOULD BE TWO PAIR.\n",

WE'RE GOING-TAKE FULL HALF CIRCLE AROUND BALL. AND, I'VE GOT-TELL YOU THIS NOT GOOD SHOT FOR POOL. IT WOULD BE VERY, VERY RARE OCCASION THAT YOU WOULD HAVE-USE-IT.

I-AM TALKING-TO BOBBY AND EVERY-OTHER WORD OUT-OF MY MOUTH WAS \"BOBBY BE CAREFUL WHAT-YOU EAT, BOBBY WATCH YOUR DIET.\" HE-ISN'T FAT. \"JUST WATCH YOUR COLON BOBBY\". WELL, HE AND HIS WIFE AND ALL THE KIDS LEFT-FOR GERMANY AND I-AM SITTING HERE, RIGHT OVER THERE, ONE AFTERNOON AND THE PHONE RINGS. IT'S HENRY COFFIN. HE SAYS \"MICKY HI\", ITS HI SOUTHERN. HE SAID \"BOBBY'S IN TROUBLE\". HE SAID \"ON THE PHONE WITH-ME IS CASPER WEINBERG, STROM THURMAN, AND WILLIAM BUCKLEY. BOBBY'S HAD A COLOSTOMY\" AND-I GAVE SUCH A SCREAM. [HE SAID] \"..AND HE WON'T DO ANYTHING UNLESS YOU TELL\". SHE WAS THE GREATEST, SUNSTARS. AND I SAID \"MR. BUCKELY MY MOTHER LOVES YOUR ACCENT\" AND HE WAS TELLING ME ABOUT BOBBY. I SAID \"PUT HIM ON A PLAN IMMEDIATELY AND GET HIM OUT-OF THERE, GET HIM TO THAT PLACE IN WASHINGTON. I FORGOT THE NAME. WALTER REED AND PUT HIM THROUGH THE PET MACHINE.\" AND THEY SAID \"ARE-YOU SURE?\" I SAID \"I AM VERY SURE\". THEY PUT HIM THE PLAN, THEY HIM THROUGH IT, AND HE'S FINE. BUT, THAT DAY LEBANON WAS BOMBED AND ALL THE SOLDIERS THAT WERE IN THAT TERRIBLE WAR ENDED-UP IN BOBBY'S HOSPITAL. BOBBY WOULD-HAVE BEEN FORGOTTEN. OF COURSE THERE'S ALWAYS PSYCHOMETRY. IF YOU RELAX, TAKE A LITTLE GLASS-OF WINE, I MEAN IT, AND RELAX AT A PARTY. TAKE SOMEONE'S RING LIKE-I USE-TO DO OR SOMETHING AND YOU'D BE SURPRISED WHAT-YOU FEEL. BIGGEST CHALLENGE AND MOST ALARMING CHALLENGE IS WHEN-I ..I AM VERY FRIENDLY WITH THE COFFINS AND THEY WERE IN SOUTH CAROLINA, COLUMBIA AND THEY STARTED ETV WHICH IS EDUCATIONAL NETWORK AND ALSO CEKA AND WE WERE VERY CLOSE FRIENDS. MRS. COFFINS' BROTHER WAS BEING SENT TO GERMANY IN THE ARMY TO BECOME A COLONIAL OR SOMETHING. SHE SAID \"WOULD-YOU MIND TALKING-TO BOBBY?\" AND-I SAID NO.\"\n",

BAD CLIMBER ETIQUETTE IS TO FILL YOUR CHALK BAG WITH ALL KINDS OF LOOSE CHALK, SIT DOWN, HAVE IT DUMPED OUT AND LEAVE A BIG MESS BEHIND, SO A NICE CONCISE CHALK BAG THAT MEETS YOUR STYLE WITH A CHALK BALL INSIDE, THAT'S GOING TO GIVE YOUR HANDS A LITTLE POWDERY COATING TO KEEP THE SWEAT DOWN, MAKES YOU GRIP THE ROCK A LITTLE BIT BETTER, MAYBE IT GIVES YOU A LITTLE PSYCHOLOGICAL ADVANTAGE TOO WHILE YOU'RE UP THERE, SO CHOOSE WHAT FITS YOU. WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT ROCK CLIMBING CHALK AND CHALK BAGS. IT USE TO BE A CONTENTIOUS ISSUE BACK IN THE 70'S OR SO, PEOPLE THOUGHT IT WAS CHEATING TO USE CHALK. NOWADAYS MOST OF EVERYONE USES IT, STILL MAKES SINCE TO THINK ABOUT OF HOW YOU USE IT, HOW MUCH YOU USE, WHAT IT DOES FOR YOU. THE BAG THAT YOU'RE GOING TO CARRY IT IN, HERE'S A COUPLE OF VARIATIONS, THEY COME IN ALL SORTS OF STYLES, SHAPES AND COLORS. GENERALLY SPEAKING, SOMETHING ABOUT THIS SIZE IS BIG ENOUGH. IF YOU'RE GOING TO BE BOULDERING AND HANGING OUT IN ONE PLACE FOR A WHILE, YOU MIGHT BUY A BIG BUCKET TO JUST SIT ON THE GROUND, BUT IF YOU'RE CARRYING IT WITH YOU, THIS IS PLENTY BIG ENOUGH. INSIDE THE BAG YOU'VE GOT CHALK IN ONE FORM OR ANOTHER, I WANT TO RECOMMEND TO YOU A CHALK BALL, BECAUSE THIS CONTAINS THE CHALK INSIDE A FABRIC COVERING. YOU CAN SEE MY HANDS ARE STILL GETTING CHALKY, BUT IT'S NOT GOING TO SPILL.\n",

SHE DOESN'T HAVE VERY MUCH IN THE WAY OF DARK SPOTS, BUT WE'RE GOING TO SHOW IT TO YOU ANYWAY. SO WE'RE JUST GOING TO TAKE A LITTLE BIT, WE'RE GOING TO PUT IT ON A Q-TIP, YOU CAN USE IT ON YOUR FINGER EASY ENOUGH. I'LL DO IT WITH MY FINGER, OR Q-TIP. AND WE'RE JUST GOING TO RUB IT ON THE DARK SPOT. JUST APPLY IT TO THE DARK SPOT. THAT'S ALL IT TAKES. I WANT YOU TO KNOW THE MORE OFTEN YOU DO THIS, IF YOU DO IT ONCE A DAY, YOU'LL GET GREAT RESULTS. IF YOU DO IT TWICE A DAY, YOU'LL GET BETTER RESULTS. THE MOST IMPORTANT THING I WANT YOU TO KNOW IS THAT YOU MUST WEAR SUNSCREEN. BECAUSE IF WE'RE GOING TO LIGHTEN THE DARK SPOTS THEN YOU GOT TO KEEP A SUNSCREEN ON SO THEY DON'T COME BACK. WE'RE GOING TO FOCUS ON YOUR FACE BECAUSE THIS IS WHERE THE AREAS WOMEN ARE MOST CONCERNED ABOUT. SO IT'S TWO PRONG, KEEP YOUR SKIN CLEAN, WELL MOISTURIZED, USE A SPOT TREATMENT, CLARINS HAS A GREAT ONE, LANCOME HAS A GREAT ONE, THERE'S ONE CALLED AMBI THAT YOU CAN GET IN THE DRUG STORE AND THAT COMES FOR OILY SKIN OR DRY SKIN, AND GET THAT SUNSCREEN ON THERE. AT LEAST A 30 BECAUSE IT MEANS YOU'RE PRONE TO SUN DAMAGE. DARK SPOTS AREN'T REALLY NECESSARILY A RESULT OF AGE, IT HAS TO DO WITH SKIN DAMAGE FROM THE SUN. I WANT YOU TO KNOW THERE'S LOTS OF PRODUCTS OUT THERE THAT CAN WORK. FROM VERY, VERY EXPENSIVE TO GREAT DRUG STORE BRANDS, IT'S JUST A MATTER OF WHAT YOU'RE BUDGET LEVEL IS AND WHAT YOU'RE COMFORTABLE WITH. THERE'S SPOT TREATMENTS. THERE'S STUFF THAT YOU CAN PUT ALL OVER YOUR WHOLE SKIN. I'M GOING TO RECOMMEND TO YOU THAT YOU JUST DO A SPOT TREATMENT. I'M GOING TO DEMONSTRATE ON MEGAN'S SKIN.\n",

NOW, DON'T THINK THAT JUST BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT BETWEEN THOSE TWO WHITE LINES THAT YOU'RE NOT AN IMPORTANT PART OF THE OFFENSE, BECAUSE EVEN THE SMARTEST BASE RUNNERS, NEEDS HELP GETTING AROUND THE BASES. SO DON'T BE FOOLED, BEING A FIRST AND THIRD BASE COACH IS ACTUALLY VERY IMPORTANT! NOW, AS A FIRST BASE COACH OR A THIRD BASE COACH YOU HAVE TO BE SMART, YOU HAVE TO HAVE A LOT OF EXPERIENCE, YOU HAVE TO MAKE SPLIT SECOND DECISIONS AND KNOW THE CAPABILITIES OF NOT ONLY THE PLAYERS ON YOUR TEAM, BUT THE PLAYERS ON THE OTHER TEAM. NOW, BETWEEN THE FIRST AND THIRD BASE COACHES, THERE'S ACTUALLY A LOT OF COMMUNICATION GOING ON, BUT EACH INDIVIDUAL COACH HAS DIFFERENT RESPONSIBILITIES. USUALLY THE FIRST BASE COACH IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE RUNNER BETWEEN HOME AND FIRST BASE. AS SOON AS THE RUNNER STARTS HEADING OUT TO SECOND BASE, THE RESPONSIBILITY GETS HANDED ONTO THE THIRD BASE COACH. NOW AS A BASE COACH YOU HAVE TO RESPOND TO DIFFERENCES IN OUTS, COUNTS, INNINGS, PLAYERS, SITUATIONS AND GAME INTENSITY. SO THERE'S A LOT TO GO INTO WHEN IT COMES TO COACHING THIRD AND FIRST BASE. AND, JUST AS IN A GAME, WHEN AN UMPIRE MAKES A BAD CALL, IT CAN CHANGE THE ENTIRE OUTCOME OF THE GAME. A BAD DECISION OR A BAD CALL BY THE FIRST OR THIRD BASE COACHES CAN ACTUALLY CHANGE THE ENTIRE GAME COMPLETELY.\n",

JUST WANT GO OVER EYE AREA AND KIND OF WIPE DOWN VERY GENTLY AND THEN AWAY FROM INNER EYE. AND IT MIGHT TAKE FEW COTTON PADS.

IT HAS ALWAYS BEEN A RARE AND IT HAS BEEN AROUND FOR A LONG TIME. SO AGAIN, WE HAVE CREATURE \"NIGHTMARE\", WHICH MEANS IT IS A NIGHTMARE CREATURE THAT GETS BENEFITS FOR ANYTHING THAT BENEFITS NIGHTMARES. \"NIGHTMARE\" COST YOU 5 AND A BLACK, WHICH MEANS ITS CONVERTED MANA COST IS 6.

      "196: ALRIGHT, SO LET US START OFF LOOKING OVER SOME OF THE MATERIALS THAT WE WILL USE FOR THESE BASIC DINGS, YOU KNOW. OBVIOUSLY, IT IS A STEP PROCESS. THAT IS WHAT SAND PAPER IS FOR. YOU GOT ONE TWENTY, TWO TWENTY. THE PREPPING USUALLY STARTS WITH THE FIFTY GRIT, WHICH IS A MUCH MORE COARSE SAND PAPER. YOU CAN FIND THAT AT ANY, YOU KNOW, HOME IMPROVEMENT STORE OR HOME DEPOT. I MEAN, ALL OF THAT STUFF. THE SECOND, YOU OBVIOUSLY YOU NEED FIBERGLASS AND RESIN. THAT IS OVER HERE. GLOVES. YOU DEFINITELY WANT TO USE GLOVES WHEN IT COMES TO USING THESE MATERIALS. WHAT WE HAVE IS, THIS IS LAMINATION RESIN. WHAT YOU WANT TO DO FIRST IS YOU WANT TO PREP AND FILL THE DING. YOU COULD GET THAT AT ANY KIND OF PLASTIC STORE. SURF SHOPS ACTUALLY CARRY MOST OF THIS DING REPAIR STUFF NOWADAYS. AFTER THE LAM RESIN, THERE IS HOT COAT RESIN. WHICH IS SURFACING AGENT RESIN, WHICH IS SANDING RESIN. AND, ALL THAT THAT IS IS LAMINATING RESIN WITH A SURFACING AGENT IN IT THAT YOU ADD. BUT, OBVIOUSLY YOU COULD BUY IT AS A HOT COAT. BRUSHES TO APPLY THE RESIN, YOU KNOW. WE GOT SQUEEGEES TO SQUEEGEE OUT THE RESIN AFTER YOU SATURATE IT. AND THEN, OBVIOUSLY YOU NEED ACETONE TO CLEAN YOUR TOOLS AND YOURSELF. WE'VE GOT FIBERGLASS, WHICH IS OBVIOUSLY REALLY IMPORTANT. AND, FOR THAT WHAT WE WILL USE IS JUST ANY KIND OF NORMAL, YOU KNOW, MAT KNIFE THAT YOU COULD GET FROM HOME DEPOT. THIS IS A FOUR OUNCE FIBER GLASS. AND, WHAT YOU DO IS, YOU KNOW, YOU USE THE RESIN TO APPLY THE FIBERGLASS AND GET IT TO BOND TO THE SURF BOARD. AND THEN, THIS IS WHAT IS CALLED Q CELL, OR MICRO BALLOONS. AND, WHAT IT IS IT IS JUST A FINELY CHOPPED FIBER GLASS. AND IT, WHAT I CALL IT IS A SURF BOARD BONDO, YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN. AND, THAT IS WHAT YOU ARE GOING TO DO. YOU ARE GOING TO MIX IT LAMINATING RESIN, AND YOU ARE GOING TO FILL THAT IN. AND, IT IS JUST GOING TO TAKE UP THE SPACE THAT WAS TAKEN AWAY FROM THE SURF BOARD. ALL DING REPAIRS, THE FIBER GLASS THAT YOU PUT ON IS ACTUALLY ON TOP OF THE SURFACE. ONCE YOU GET IT BACK TO ITS NORMAL STATE, THAT IS WHEN YOU DO YOUR STRUCTURAL DAMAGE, YOU KNOW. ANY STRAIGHT EDGE, YOU KNOW, EVEN A RAZOR BLADE WILL WORK IN SOME OF THESE INSTANCES. AND, APPLY THOSE PRODUCTS. FROM OUR TOOLS AND MATERIALS, LET US GET INTO THE REAL SAFETY PART OF THIS PROCESS. YOU DEFINITELY WANT SAND PAPER. GOLDEN RULE ABOUT SURFBOARD REPAIR, RESIN WILL NOT BOND TO ANYTHING THAT IS NOT PREPPED WHICH MEANS IT HAS TO BE COARSE AND SANDED. SO, IF YOU THINK YOU CAN JUST POUR THE RESIN IN THE HOLE AND IT WILL BOND, IT WILL NOT. AT LEAST SAND IT FIRST. RESIN WILL BOND TO IT.\n",

      "344: YOU/PLURAL WANT TALK LITTLE-BIT ABOUT SECURITY AND SOME OF THING/YOU-PLURAL-CAN DO MAKE IT LITTLE MORE DIFFICULT FOR THIEF GET IN YOUR HOUSE. THING/YOU-PLURAL NEED DO IS JUST STEP YOUR FOOT ON BOTTOM OF DOOR, PUSH THAT LATCH CLOSE AND IF YOU ARE GOING BE GONE FOR LONG PERIOD/TIME LIKE YOU ARE GOING ONVACATION, MOST LATCH/HAVE HOLE AND YOU CAN ACTUALLY PUT PADLOCK THROUGH IT TOO. HERE'S EXAMPLE OF DOOR THAT IS NEARLY PERFECTLY SET UP. YOU/HAVE GOT DOOR HANDLE WITH KEY, YOU/HAVE GOT DEADBOLT AND DOOR FRAME ITSELF IS ACTUALLY RECESSED IN SO THAT YOU CAN'T GET CREDIT CARD IN BEHIND HERE. COUPLE OF THING/THAT I DID NOTICE ABOUT THIS DOOR. ONE, THIS LOCK SET UP PROPERLY, INSTALLED PROPERLY BUT DEADBOLT YOU WILL SEE IS ACTUALLY UPSIDE DOWN. THIS CAUSE PROBLEM WITH SPRINGS. EVENTUALLY THAT WILL CAUSE WEAKNESS IN SPRINGS AND LOCK WILL FAIL BECAUSE IT IS HANGING UPSIDE DOWN AND YOU DON'T HAVE GRAVITY IN YOUR FAVOR. ANOTHER SECURITY ISSUE THAT I SEE WITH THIS DOOR IS THIS WINDOW. THIS IS REALLY QUICK EASY WAY FOR THIEF GET IN AND ACTUALLY THIEF LOVE SEE THESE BECAUSE HE WALK/UP, THROW ROCK THROUGH THIS WINDOW AND REACH IN AND UNLOCK DOOR AND AWAY YOU GO. IN THIS CASE, THIS IS DOOR THAT LEAD FROM GARAGE TO HOUSE. YOU/WILL SEE THERE'S NO DEADBOLT. NICE THING IS THAT DOOR FRAME IS BUILT PROPERLY. DRAWBACK IS AS WITH ANY LOCK IF YOU DON'T LOCK IT, IT DOESN'T DO YOU MUCH GOOD. THAT IS ONE OF THING/THAT I CAN STRESS MOST. WHEN I COME TO HOUSE THAT SOMEBODY HAS LOCKED THEIR KEY/IN HOUSE, I CAN ALMOST FIND WINDOW THAT IS CRACKED, DOOR THAT IS OPEN OR SOME WAY OF ENTRY WITHOUT EVEN PICKING LOCK. ONE OF COMMON THING/THAT I FIND IN HOUSE/WHEN I COME TO UNLOCK THEM IS GARAGE. THIS GARAGE DOOR HAS OPENER AND IT WILL HOLD DOOR TO CERTAIN EXTENT BUT IF YOU DON'T USE THIS LATCH OR DON'T HAVE ONE OF THESE LATCH/NOTHING ELSE IS GOING HELP AND THIS IS JUST QUICK EASY WAY FOR SOMEONE GET IN.\n",

      "HI MY NAME RACHEL I OWNER OF AUSTIN STYLE WATCH COM STREET FASHION SITE I ALSO FREELANCE REPORTER. TODAY WE TALKING ABOUT HOW TELL REAL LEATHER FROM FAKE LEATHER. WITH FAKE LEATHER IT MORE LIKE PRINTED PATTERN AND YOU NOT SEEING PORES AND YOU NOT SEEING ANY OF NATURAL LEATHER IMPERFECTIONS YOU JUST GOING SORT OF SEE PERFECT LEATHER PRINTED PATTERN. NEXT STEP WE LOOK AT IS IF THERE ANY CUT EDGES. ON LEATHER IT SHOULD BE ROUGH ON FAKE LEATHER IT SHOULD BE VERY CLEAN CUT. SO THIS FAKE THIS REAL. SO ON THIS WE CAN KIND OF LOOK ON INSIDE OF THIS BOOT UP HERE AROUND CORNER WHERE IT NOT EXACTLY VERY NEAT IT KIND OF GOT WRINKLES AND ROUGHNESS IT NOT TOTALLY CLEAN CUT IT LEATHER ITS PIECE Y LITTLE BIT. THINGS LIKE THIS BOOT LEATHER CUTS ARE REALLY JUST AS CLEAN AS IF THEY WERE PLASTIC AND THAT HOW YOU CAN TELL NOT REAL LEATHER. SO THIS BEEN HOW YOU CAN TELL REAL LEATHER FROM FAKE LEATHER. SO FIRST TIP WE GOING DO AND THIS SEEM REALLY EASY AND ITS ACTUALLY NOT ALWAYS POSSIBLE BUT JUST LOOK AT LABEL SEE IF IT SAY LEATHER. FOR THINGS LIKE BOOTS A LOT OF TIMES YOU FIND IT RIGHT HERE ON SOLE. FOR NEWER BOOTS YOU FIND IT INSIDE USUALLY ON TAG SOMETIMES LIKE THAT ONE OR YOU MIGHT ALSO FIND IT ON BOTTOM ON SOLE. SO IF IT NOT SAY LEATHER ON IT 100 PERCENT LEATHER SOMETIMES IT MIGHT SAY LEATHER UPPERS WHICH WOULD MEAN TOPS LEATHER NOT SOLE THAT WAY YOU KNOW IT LEATHER. SO THESE ARE BOTH VINTAGE THESE ARE OLD THEY NOT HAVE THOSE LABELS ANYMORE SO LETS TAKE NEXT STEP. NOW THIS ONE KIND OF GROSSES ME OUT LITTLE BIT BUT IT GREAT WAY TO TELL WHETHER ITS REALLY LEATHER OR NOT AND THAT TAKE REALLY CLOSE LOOK AT SKIN AND LOOK FOR PORES. AND THESE ARE JUST LIKE PORES THAT YOU SEE IN OUR SKIN THE LITTLE HOLES THAT ARE IN YOUR SKIN THAT LET IT BREATHE JUST LIKE US COWS AND ALL OTHER ANIMALS YOU MIGHT MAKE LEATHER OUT OF HAVE PORES IN THEIR SKIN. SO IF YOU LOOK REALLY CLOSELY AT LEATHER YOU SHOULD SEE JUST KIND OF NATURAL IMPERFECTIONS OF PORES WRINKLES THINGS THAT HAVE HAPPENED IN TANNING PROCESS.\n",

      "224: NOW WE-RE GOING-TO DECORATE OUR BOAT. WE-RE GOING-TO-BE DECORATING THE BOAT WITH PERMANENT MARKER BECAUSE WE DON-T WANT ANY OF THE COLORS TO RUN WHEN THE BOAT GOES INTO THE WATER. THE NEXT DECORATION WE WANT TO-DO IS WE-RE GOING-TO GO TO THE BASE OF THE BOAT AND WE-RE GOING-TO MAKE KIND OF A LINE DOWN WHICH WILL KIND OF LOOK LIKE THE RIM. I GUESS LIKE THE RUBBER BOARDER THAT GOES AROUND THE BOAT SO IT DOESN-T BANG INTO ANYTHING WHEN IT COMES CLOSE TO THE DOCK OR WHEN IT GETS TIED UP. SO, WE-LL PUT A LINE AROUND THE BORDER, AROUND THE BASE OF THE BOAT AND IT WON-T JUST BE ONE LINE WE-LL ACTUALLY FILL IN SOME OTHER COLORS TO MAKE IT STAND OUT A LITTLE MORE. THIS IS REALLY THE KEY TO THIS ONE DECORATION IS KIND OF THE KEY TO MAKING IT KIND OF STAND OUT AND LOOK LIKE A, SOMEWHAT OF A REAL BOAT. THIS IS REALLY, EVEN THOUGH IT MAY NOT REALIZE IT, THIS REALLY STANDS OUT ON BOATS THAT YOU HAVE THAT THICK BORDER GOING AROUND THE BASE. SO, THIS WILL HELP US MAKE IT REALLY LOOK MORE AUTHENTIC. WE-LL PUT OUR FIRST COLOR AROUND, WE USED A RED. WE-LL GO AHEAD AND TAKE A SECOND COLOR AND COMPLETE THE SHAPE TO IT. SO WE-VE MADE TWO LINES AND WE-VE MADE A WAVED LINE GOING DOWN THE MIDDLE. NOW, THE FRONT OF OUR BOAT NEEDS TO HAVE A WINDOW SO WE-LL USE OUR THIN MARKER TO MAKE OUR BORDER. THE FIRST THING WE-RE GOING-TO-DO IS OUTLINE DIFFERENT SHAPES ON THE BOAT. YOU CAN EXPERIMENT WITH SOME DIFFERENT MARKERS. THE LINES COME OUT NOT AS DARK WHEN YOU-RE USING MAKERS AS OPPOSED TO IF YOU WERE GOING-TO USE SOME PAINT. A TYPE OF PAINT THAT IS GOOD FOR IT IS, LIKE WE SAID EARLIER, THE TYPE OF PAINT WOULD BE THE SAME PAINT THAT-S USED TO DECORATE CLOTH LIKE A T-SHIRT BECAUSE THAT-S THE TYPE OF PAINT THAT YOU CAN THROW IN THE WASHING MACHINE AND IT DOESN-T COME OFF. OF COURSE WHEN OUR BOAT IS PLACED IN THE WATER WE WANT THE PAINT TO STAY ON AS WELL. SO, THE PAINT WOULD DEFINITELY GIVE IT MORE OF A STRONGER EFFECT BUT WE ALSO WANTED TO SHOW YOU THAT MOST PEOPLE HAVE THESE MARKERS AROUND THEIR HOUSE AND WE WANTED TO MAKE THE PROJECT AS PRACTICAL AS POSSIBLE TO SHOW YOU THAT IT CAN ALSO BE DONE WITH THESE MARKERS. I-LL PUT A LITTLE DECORATION ON THE FLAG, WE-LL JUST PUT A STAR. YOU CAN PUT YOUR FAMILY INSIGNIA IF YOU HAVE ONE. AND HERE, WE SEE THAT ONCE THE BOAT IS PLACED INTO WATER IT ACTUALLY DOES FLOAT. SO IT-S A REALLY NICE PROJECT FOR KIDS AND THEY COME OUT WITH A NICE TOY THAT THEY CAN PLAY WITH AT BATH TIME. IF YOU-RE GOING-TO PUT IT INTO THE BATH THE GLUE AND THE COLOR SHOULD HOLD, BUT I WOULD TAKE OUT THE TOOTHPICK, OBVIOUSLY MIGHT BE A BIT OF A SAFETY HAZARD. FOR OUR DESIGN WE-RE GOING-TO-BE MAKING SOME WINDOWS ON THE TOP LAYER. BUT THEY CAN HAVE A LOT OF FUN WITH THE BOAT, SOAK IT UP WITH WATER, WATCH IT GO UNDER, COME UP AGAIN, AND IT-S A LOT OF FUN. SO, USE THE BLACK, THIN MARKER. PERMANENT MARKER. WE MADE OUR OUTLINE AND NOW WE-RE GOING-TO FILL IT IN WITH SOME COLORS. I-M USING A BLUE COLOR NOW. WE GO AHEAD AND DO THE OTHER SIDE THE SAME WITH THE WINDOWS. IT-S EASIER TO OUTLINE EVERYTHING FIRST SO WHEN YOU DRAW, PUT THE ACTUAL COLORS ON, THEY KEEP THEIR SHAPE AND ALSO THE BORDER AROUND THE DIFFERENT SHAPES GIVES A NICE, MAKES IT STAND OUT A LITTLE MORE, GIVES A NICE AFFECT TO IT, HAS A NICE TOUCH.\n",

SAY, FROM MOVING IT FROM ONE LOCATION TO ANOTHER. MARVEL AID WORKS REAL WELL FOR MINOR THINGS. BUT THERE IS NOTHING THAT CAN BEAT INTELLIGENCE AND KNOWLEDGE OF AVIAN VET WHEN YOU HAVE SICK BIRD. AND MORE THAN LIKELY, THAT WILL BE ONLY WAY YOU'LL BE ABLE SAVE THAT BIRD. IF YOUR BIRD HAS BEEN EXPOSED TO SMOKE, NEAR FIRE OR ANYWHERE WHERE SMOKE HAS GOT TO BIRD, BIRDS CANNOT GET THAT SMOKE OUT OF THEIR LUNGS. THEY MAY GO ON FOR MONTHS AND NEVER SHOW SIGN, AND THEN ALL OF SUDDEN, YOU LOOSE THAT BIRD. FIRES ARE VERY DANGEROUS TO BIRDS, AND, I MYSELF EVEN HAD FIRE IN WHICH I THOUGHT MY BIRDS WERE FINE, AND THEN MONTHS LATER I STARTED LOOSING THEM, AND IT WAS SAID THAT IT WAS DUE TO SMOKE IN THEIR LUNG. THEN BIRD NEEDS WARMTH. USE HEATING PAD, BROODER, ANYTHING THAT YOU CAN TO GET WARMTH TO THAT BIRD. I WOULD SUGGEST HIGHLY THAT WHEN YOU KNOW BIRD IS SICK, THAT YOU SEE, AN AVIAN VET. THEY'RE NOT LOT OF AVIAN VETS AROUND, BUT THERE ARE MANY GOOD ONES AROUND. REASON BEING, THAT BIRD DOES NOT SHOW THAT IT IS SICK, UNTIL IT IS WELL SICK. BECAUSE, THEY ARE ATTUNED TO HIDING ANY ILLNESS AWAY FROM THEIR FLOCK SO THAT THEY WON'T BE BANNED FROM FLOCK. SO, BY TIME YOU CAN SEE THAT BIRD IS SICK, IT HAS BEEN SICK FOR WHILE. I USE MARVEL AID IF BIRD IS JUST BEING STRESSED.\n",
